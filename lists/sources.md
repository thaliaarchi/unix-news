  > UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the
  > Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers.

  > This is a revised version of a paper presented at the Fourth ACM Symposium
  > on Operating Systems Principles, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center,
  > Yorktown Heights, New York, October 15-17, 1973.

  > There have been three versions of UNIX. The earliest version (circa 1969-70)
  > ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers. The second
  > version ran on the unprotected PDP-11/20 computer. This paper describes only
  > the PDP-11/40 and /45 [1] system since it is more modern and many of the
  > differences between it and older UNIX systems result from redesign of
  > features found to be deficient or lacking.
  >
  > Since PDP-11 UNIX became operational in February 1971, about 40
  > installations have been put into service; they are generally smaller than
  > the system described here. Most of them are engaged in applications such as
  > the preparation and formatting of patent applications and other textual
  > material, the collection and processing of trouble data from various
  > switching machines within the Bell System, and recording and checking
  > telephone service orders. Our own installation is used mainly for research
  > in operating systems, languages, computer networks, and other topics in
  > computer science, and also for document preparation.

  The number of UNIX News members:
  > Circulation 37 [page 1]

  > There were no objections to publishing the mailing list and so we are
  > including it in this issue.  The integer part of the sequence number on the
  > first line corresponds to a list of licensees that Ken Thompson keeps.  The
  > fractional part designates multiple installations under a single license.

  > each, provided we receive a returned copy of the coupon on the invitation to
  > subscribe.
  >
  > The original letter went to approximately 76 people, all but 6 of whom
  > replied.  Subsequent letters recently went to 20 new installations and, to
  > date the mailing list contains 37 names.  Our only communications problems
  > are with locations where the only name is a contracts officer and with

  Any installations which did not respond to the letter were removed from the
  list, creating the gaps in the Ken's sequence numbers. The highest number in
  the sequence is 51, which matches Ken's list from a month prior, so it is
  unlikely there were any new licensees since then.
