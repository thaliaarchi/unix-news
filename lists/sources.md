- Ken's list from Dennis_Tapes, June 27, 1975:
  51 UNIX licensees listed and 55 installations listed

  In a DECtape donated by Dennis Ritchie is a `fed(6)`/`form(6)` form letter
  document from Ken listing UNIX licensees that closely resembles the first UNIX
  News list. It is generated with the `nmrc` shell script in V6. See Jonathan

  The number of UNIX News members:
  > Circulation 37 [page 1]

  > There were no objections to publishing the mailing list and so we are
  > including it in this issue.  The integer part of the sequence number on the
  > first line corresponds to a list of licensees that Ken Thompson keeps.  The
  > fractional part designates multiple installations under a single license.
  > Since we now have several such, we will mail a copy of the newsletter to

  > subscribe.

  > The original letter went to approximately 76 people, all but 6 of whom
  > replied.  Subsequent letters recently went to 20 new installations and, to
  > date the mailing list contains 37 names.  Our only communications problems
  > are with locations where the only name is a contracts officer and with
  > multiple installations.  I would ask each of you to scan the list of names

  > [page 1]

  Any installations which did not respond to the letter were removed from the
  list, creating the gaps in the Ken's sequence numbers. The highest number in
  the sequence is 51, which matches Ken's list from a month prior, so it is
  unlikely there were any new licensees since then.
