                            URBANA MEETING

     Announcement of the Urbana meeting and a map of the campus appear
in  this  issue.  Those wishing to be placed on the agenda should con-
tact Steve Holmgren as soon as possible.

     Since very little, if any, of the discussions at meetings in fact
involves  "disclosure",  it  was decided, at the last Harvard meeting,
that we would not bar non-licensees from our meetings.   If  there  is
need  for a session at which "disclosure" does take place, the program
committee will schedule a "closed" meeting.

     The next issue of this newsletter will be posted  no  later  than
May  5th  in  New  York  so it should arrive during the following week
everywhere.  It will contain the final notice of the meeting  and  the
preliminary  agenda.   Reservations for lodging should be made as soon
as possible.


                               NEW BOOK

     Your attention is called to the book announced in the letter from
New  South  Wales.   Orders should be sent as soon as possible so they
may determine their print order.  Ken Thompson has seen the first ver-
sion of the book and reports that it is a good job.


                          LICENSED MATERIALS

     We have just received a new list of available licensed  materials
from Western electric.  The list will appear in the May issue since we
want to keep this newsletter and its sequel small to  speed  delivery.
Among  the items listed are mini-UNIX (previously announced) and "PHO-
TOTYPESETTER VERSION 7" which is new.  It operates under UNIX and  in-
cludes  text  formatting and mathematical processing.  For further de-
tails contact Dick Shahpazian 919-697-2861.
