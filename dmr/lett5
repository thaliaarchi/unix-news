Dear. Mr. Ligett:

Pursuant to our telehone conversation a few days ago,
I am sending you a copy of the paper by Ken Thompson and
me on the UNIX system.
It was presented at this fall's SIGOPS conference
and will be published in the CACM.

As I mentioned to you, UNIX is now being licensed only
to educational institutions.
If you wish to find out its precise
status, you may write to

	Mr R. G. Shahpazian
	Room 400
	Western Electric Company
	222 Broadway
	New York, New York, 10038

You should send a copy of your letter to

	Mr. S. P. Morgan
	...

Mr Shapazian will acknowledge your letter and will
inform you as soon as any final decisions are made.
