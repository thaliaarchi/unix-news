Dear Prof. Peebles:

As I gather you have heard from Steve Johnson,
UNIX may now be licensed for use by educational
institutions.
The detailed manual can only be
released as part of the system as a whole,
but I am enclosing a preprint version of a
general paper on the system.
It was presented to this year's SIGOPS
conference and will appear, in slightly different
form, in the Communications of the ACM.

I have also given your name to Mr S. P. Morgan, who will
contact you concerning the
formalities of obtaining a license to use UNIX.
