Attn: Wayne Schmidt

Dear Mr. Schmidt:

In response to your request for information about UNIX,
I am sending you a preprint of a paper which will be published in
the Communications of the ACM in their
issue devoted to papers from this year's SIGOPS
conference.

Actually the paper as published will be slightly different
because some of the information on which is based has changed
and also because of referee's suggestions.

If after reading the paper
you are still interested in using UNIX,
you should write to

	S. P. Morgan
	Bell Telephone Laboratories
	Murray Hill N. J. 07974

I understand that it not yet clear
whether UNIX will be licensed for use by non-educational institutions,
but Mr. Morgan will be able to give you guidance.
