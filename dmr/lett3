Dear Mr Lipkin:

Thank you for your letter.
Even though it is probably identical to the UNIX paper you saw,
I am sending you a preprint of an article which will be published in
the Communications of the ACM in their
issue devoted to papers from this year's SIGOPS
conference.

Actually the paper as published will be slightly different
because some of the information on which is based has changed
and also because of referee's suggestions.

At the moment it is not clear whether UNIX will be licensed
to other than educational institutions,
nor is it clear whether your institution
qualifies as an educational institution.
Therefore I have given your
letter to Mr. S. P. Morgan,
who will inquire into the situation
and let you know what our position is.

Although our supply
of publicly available written material is slim,
we would be happy to have you visit and take a look
at the system.
There a UNIX installation in San Francisco,
but
it time-shares its attention among switching machines
instead of humans and so is unavailable.
