Dear Mr. Eastburn:

Thank you for your letter of October 30.
I am enclosing a copy of our
paper presented at the SIGOPS conference;
it will be published, in
slightly modified form, in the CACM.

UNIX is a proprietary system available
only through a licensing agreement with 
Western Electric Company.
These agreements are currently being
made with educational institutions on a royalty-free
basis, bo far there has been no decision as to whether
to conclude such agreements with commercial firms.
I understand the matter is being discussed, however,
and if you are interested in UNIX you may write for
information on its status to

	Mr R. G. Shahpazian
	Room 400
	Western Electric Company
	222 Broadway
	New York, New York 10038

You should also send a copy of your letter to

	Mr. S. P. Morgan
	Rm. ---
	Bell Telephone Laboratories
	Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974

Mr. Shapazian will acknowledge your letter and will notify
you as soon as any final decisions are made.
