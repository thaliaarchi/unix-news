Dear Mr Read:

Since there has at last been a decision on the
release of the UNIX system,
I went through my files
and found your letter of October 18, 1972.

UNIX is now available on a royalty-free basis to educational institutions
through a licensing agreement with Western Electric
Company.
No decision has been made, however, whether to extend
such agreements to commercial firms.
The exact situation of Merit Computer Network is not clear
to me, but in view of its sponsorship,
it seems possible that a license might be arranged.

I am enclosing a paper on UNIX which was presented at this fall's
SIGOPS conference and which will appear in the CACM.
If after the passage of time, and after you read the paper,
you are still interested in UNIX, you may write to

	Mr R. G. Shahpazian
	Room 400
	Western Electric Company
	222 Broadway
	New York, New York, 10038

and request a copy of the licensing agreement.
Since it is not transparently obvious that Merit
Computer Network is an educational institution,
you should indicate just what your firm's situation is.
You should also send a copy of your letter
to
	Mr. S. P. Morgan
	Room ---
	BTL

Your letters
to me and Ken Thompson indicated special interest in the
C language.
Since UNIX itself and much of its software
are written in C,
its description and
compiler are included in the UNIX package.
