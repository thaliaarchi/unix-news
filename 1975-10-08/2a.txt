             easily modified to dump other types of disks.

     6.  UC San Diego

         a.  Runs UNIX on a Cal Data 145.

         b.  Has a "machine independent interface" and a driver that
             allows them to communicate with other machines and devices
             at their installation.

         c.  Has a very fast Fortran compiler.
