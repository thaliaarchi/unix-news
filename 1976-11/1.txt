                            SECOND SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION

     On the following pages you will find an  announcement  of  the  availability  of  the
Second Software Distribution and its contents.

     Magnetic tapes should be sent to:

                    Michael T. O'Brien
                    Dept. of Information Engineering
                    University of Illinois at Chicago Circle
                    Box 4348
                    Chicago, Illinois 60680

     As noted in the announcement the default request is for the latest distribution which
will  be  in  "stp"  format (see below).  To receive anything else you must have explicit,
understandable instructions.  To get either the Harvard or Toronto distributions you  must
submit  an  executed  license  agreement  and  be  an  academic institution, i. e.  a non-
commercial licensee of Western Electric.  Commercial licensees must deal with Toronto  and
Harvard on an individual basis.


                              ADDITION TO THE DISTRIBUTION

     Included in the distribution will be two new forms ot tp.  One is  a  rewrite  of  tp
from assembler to c.  It is believed by the author to be identical in function to standard
tp.  The second is an enhancement for magnetic tape called super-tp (stp).  It allows  up-
dates to an stp magtape.  The distribution referred to above will be written with stp.  It
may be read with standard tp, but any additions to the standard distribution on  the  same
tape  will  be placed there by an update run of stp and will be readable only by stp.  The
documentation of stp on the distribution tape will be self explanatory (we hope).


                                        STOP PRESS

     The following message was just received from Chicago Circle.

        I got the "diff" listing of all changes to Bell Unix system proper from "standard"
version 6, which apparently means the currently distributed version 6.  There are some bug
fixes which are not in my version 6, which are in the currently distributed  v6.   Anyway,
I've  itemized  some  50  changes, and sent the list to Ken for verification and comments.
The changes will be available through the center by special request: hence, the uninitiat-
ed  will  not  be  tempted to do a number on themselves, as they might be if the mess were
suddenly dumped in their laps.

        Also, a new tape is in the process of preparation, and should be available as soon
as  it  clears  the lawyers, for the usual free license and handling fee.  It contains the
new nroff, the new C, the new I/O library (faster & smaller than anything to date), and a
bunch of other such things.  It will be available from Bell, not the Center.  Ken is going
to send a formal notice to the News.

WARNING:  Most of us do not have the "currently districted V6".  CAVEAT EMPTOR
