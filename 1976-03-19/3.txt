                                  MAILING LIST

     The attached mailing list is a major revision of the old list.  It is based
upon  a list of licensees dated February 1976 and is ordered on state and by zip
code within the state.  It is likely that errors have crept in during the  edit-
ing.   Please check your listing and send in corrections.  An area of difficulty
is multiple installations under a single license.  If  you  know  of  facilities
other than those listed, please let us know.


                               SOFTWARE EXCHANGE

     As of a few days ago, there were no user submissions to  the  software  ex-
change.   The  exchange  does have a new C compiler and a new ar.c.  We hope the
lack of submissions indicates that everybody is busy putting things in shape  to
send in.

     In setting up the exchange, we are hoping that people will send in  "trivi-
al"  things as well as significant things.  The trivial is often the most dupli-
cated in effort.


                                    MANUALS

     Informal discussions indicate that  permission  might  be  granted  to  the
Users' Group to allow a single printer to reproduce the manuals and sell them to
us in individual or quantity lots.  In order to determine whether this  is  rea-
sonable or desirable, we need an estimate of the number of copies of each of the
manuals you might order.  If you  are  interested  in  this  collective  venture
please contact Lou Katz (see mailing list).
