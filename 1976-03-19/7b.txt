Interprocess Communication (IPC):

    Steve Zucker and Carl Sunshine presented the shortcomings of
Current UNIX IPC facilities.  Steve outlined his Port and mpipe
implementation.   (The two Rand papers had been passed out the
day before, but few attendees had had a chance to read them.) There
was agreement from several other sites that an ability to wait for
multiple inputs would be very desirable, and that mpipes seemed a
good way to do this.  Bob Fabry was unhappy with the different
interface mpipes provided to the reader (the presence of headers).
