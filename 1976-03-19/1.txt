                               MEETING AT HARVARD

     The next meeting in the East will be held at Harvard  University  on  April
first and second.  The letter with details on hotels, which appeared in the last
issue, is repeated below.

     Thursday, April 1 will be devoted mostly to graphics.  The meeting will be-
gin  at  1:00 PM on that day so that most people will be able to arrive thursday
morning.  The Lecture Hall will be available into the evening.  We will have ac-
cess  to  the Harvard-Radcliffe system on thursday evening and during the day on
friday.

     The friday session will begin at 10:00 AM and last as  long  as  necessary.
In  addition  to  the usual short reports by installations, there will be longer
reports by:

               Tucker Taft on the HRSTS system.
               Bruce Borden on Fortran IV Plus under UNIX
               Helnz Lycksama on MERT
                                 The Satellite Processor system
                                 Mini-UNIX and LSI-UNIX.
               Dennis Ritchie on the C compiler and the future of UNIX.

     The Lecture Hall is equipped for demonstrations.   A  terminal  with  large
screen  display is available and may be used with the HRSTS system or, via dial-
up, with your own system.  If you are bringing materials to mount at Harvard for
demonstration, we remind you that the only transfer medium on the Harvard system
is Dectape.  If you need to mount from other media, and if you  hurry,  arrange-
ments can be made to copy your materials to Dectape from RK05 or magtape (800 or
1600)  in  New  York.   Contact  Mel  Fercutz   (212-780-5569)   or   Lou   Katz
(232-579-8501) for details.  Another possibility would be to transmit the files,
if your UNIX can be made to look like a terminal, to either UNIX or Wylbur.   To
transmit  to UNIX or Wylbur in New York, contact Ira Fuchs (232-977-0000).  Call
Lew Law (617-495-2627)  if  you  wish  to  explore  the  possibility  of  direct
transmission  to HRSTS.  If you have any special audio-visual needs, contact Lew
Law's office.
