    An impressive amount of software has been developed for
HRSTS.  The following items were mentioned:

    1.  BASIC:  two versions, one based on DEC RT11 BASIC
                with matrix extensions, another based on
                DEC RSTS BASIC (which users must first purchase
                from DEC).
    2.  MACRO
        LINKER - (Version 6 compatible)
        DDT - (Brought to RAND by Bob Greenberg)
    3.  TECO editor
    4.  PILCOM - (like diff)
    4.- HARVARD SHELLS:
                A simplified shell for student use (hand-holding)
                Command completion as in TENEX
    6.  Terminal driver with several interesting features
                (a) Page mode for graphics terminals
                (b) Setable break characters
                (c) The ability to suspend and restart output
    7.  PPL and ECLI  Extensible languages
                Manuals can be obtained from:
                Center for Research in Computing Techniques
                33 Oxford Street
                Cambridge, Massachusetts  07138

Chuck also spoke of a very good (fast) Fortran that runs under
UNIX.  It is a modification of DEC Fortran and it is available
(after paying DEC a $2500 fee) from:
                Dick Shore
                CULC (Commercial Union Leasing Corp.)
                New York

The Berkeley 11/70 System - Ken Thompson________________________________________

    Berkeley runs a severely core-limited system, having only
64K words of memory to support an average load of 15 users
(22-24 users peak).  They use four "home-brew" multiplexers,
each having 8 lines.  Three of the lines are connected to 11/10
machines used for teaching assembly language programming and
interrupt I/O.  They have 2 RK05 disks, an RJS04 swapping
disk, and 2 RP03 compatible DIVA disks (50 megabytes each).
