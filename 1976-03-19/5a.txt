UCLA Security Kernel - Gerry Popek__________________________________

    The object of the UCLA work is to produce a verifiably secure
operating system.  UCLA has implemented a security kernel in PASCAL
(a PASCAL to C translator is available from UCLA) and hope to apply
automatic verification to the PASCAL code.  The kernel has been
designed to be the minimum amount of software that can guarantee
data security.  The code consists of 4-5K words, includng a few
drivers, and was initially designed as the basis for a Virtual
Machine Monitor (VMM).  For the sake of efficiency they have
decided to try instead to interface UNIX directly to the security
kernel by system calls in the same fashion as MERT, the Bell Labs
Multi-Environment Real Time System.  They plan to run a separate
stripped down version of UNIX in supervisor mode as a part of each
UNIX "process" with the various UNIXs communicating by means of
shared segments and a kernel supplied message facility.  No attempt
is made to guarantee confinement.  The kernel is to provide
protection for processes, devices, whole file systems, and
segments, so the size of the protected objects is large ("the grain
of protection is coarse").

    In addition to the UNIX processes, there will be a scheduler
process and an initiator, the former providing data to the kernel
assigning execution priorties to the various processes, and the
latter replacing the UNIX logon process with code that establishes
the protection environment for the user that signs on.

    The main problems anticipated are:

    (1) The coordination of use of the shared segments
        between UNIXs.  One shared segment wil be used for
        the storage of inodes, file table entries, etc. for
        each file system.  Semaphores may be required in
        addition to the kernel message facility to coordinate
        access to these segments.
    (2) Constructing an ARPANET NCP or TCP.  It is likely that
        some of this will have to be built into the kernel

    Eugene Wong described the Interactive Graphics and Retrieval
System (INGRES) that runs on a PDP 11/40 under UNIX.  The current
system uses four large processes that call each other sequentially.
Some benefit could be obtained from better interprocess communication
so that some of the processes could proceed in parallel.
(See the ..CC '75 for details on INGRES.)
