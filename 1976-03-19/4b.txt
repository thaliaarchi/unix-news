SUBJECT: NOTES ON WEST COAST UNIX USER'S MEETING,
         Berkeley, California, February 27-28, 1976



    The meeting was attended by about 35 people (half from
Berkeley), and hosted by Bob Fabry (Berkeley).  (See us for a
complete list of participants and addresses.)  First there were
four major presentations on the UCLA Security Kernel, The INGRES
data base system, The Harvard Radcliffe Student Timesharing System
(HRSTS), and the Berkeley PDP 11/70 system (Ken Thompson).  Then
each attendee presented a brief summary of activity at his site.
Friday evening and Saturday were devoted to discussing several
general topics of interest including interprocess communication,
the ARPANET software, multiple-machine UNIX systems, and UNIX
development and standards.  This note summarizes each of these
three areas.
