                             JOHNS HOPKINS SOFTWARE

     The Unix Hotline has on it notices from Johns  Hopkins  University  on  the
availability of several pieces of software.

     A version of BASIC-PLUS (version 5B-24) adapted for Unix is available  from
Johns Hopkins University, Department of Electrical Engineering. It is fully com-
patible with RSTS/E BASIC-PLUS: nearly any program run on RSTS/E BASIC will work
on this one.  The only exceptions are:

               1) programs are limited to 12K
               2) None of the privileged "sys" calls are available; most
   of the unprivileged ones are.

All of the I/O facilities of BASIC-PLUS (record I/O, virtual arrays, etc.)  work
on  the  Unix  version:  full  pathnames  can be specified on OPEN, RUN, NAME-AS
statements. A "public library" feature allows one to keep frequently used  BASIC
programs  in  a  directory  which  is referenced whenever a '$' is prefixed to a
pathname.

Binary copies are available to those with  a  RSTS  binary  license;  source  is
available  to those with source license. Distribution is available on Dectape or
RK disk.

     A UNIXed version of MACRO (PDP-11 assembler) is available from JHU Electri-
cal  Engineering.   It has "macro library" and "cross reference" capability, and
is reasonably efficient. To get binary, you need a DEC MACRO binary license  for
RT11,  RSX11D,  or  DOS; to get source, a DEC source license. Distribution on RK
disks or DECtape.

     A UNIXed version of Per Brinch-Hansen's "Sequential  Pascal"  compiler  and
interpreter  are available from JHU-Electrical Engineering The compiler is writ-
ten in Pascal, consists of 7 passes, and is  rather slow. Output from  the  com-
piler  is  run under a separate Pascal interpreter.  Compiled files can call the
interpreter automatically;  hence  Pascal  programs cam be invoked as  commands.
The  lexical  conventions  have  been  improved   over  Brinch-Hansen's original
specification;  lowercase and tabs are accepted,  and  []  are  used  for  array
specifiers  instead  of (. .). Most of the  UNIX system  entries  can be invoked
from Pascal; users can easily add their own following the design  of  those  al-
ready installed.

Prerequisite software: MACRO assembler (available  from  JHU  for licensees) and
Jeff Rottman's Linker (available from Princeton).

Distribution on RK disk or Dectape.
