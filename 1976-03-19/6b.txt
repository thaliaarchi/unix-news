    6. Using the technique in 5, Ken determined that for the
       Berkeley system it was more efficient to sue the RJS04
       "swapping" disk for the "root" file system (/usr, /tmp, ...)
       and an RK04 for swapping.

    7. A bottleneck was eliminated by allocating two swap buffer
       headers to avoid putting a process to sleep only to wake
       it up again to be swapped out.

    8. Bell labs is working on a C-oriented microprocessor.
       Get in touch with Sandy Fraser at Bell for information.

    9. We learned several things that may improve our response.

       a. Allocate more buffers.  Berkeley uses 30, and we are
          certainly underallocated.  A measurement technique
          for determining buffer utilization was suggested.
       b. The terminal output high and low water marks were set
          for the 300 baud terminals in use at Bell.  With our
          9600 baud terminals we should greatly increase these
          parameters, and the number of character queue elements.
