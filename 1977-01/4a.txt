Dear Sir:

     I was given your name, from a few sources, as the person to contact
regarding the availability of software to run under UNIX.

     I am investigating the possibility of using a PDP11/34 as a "smart"
terminal to acquire access to various large-scale computers and to perform
some local applications.  There are a few pieces of software I need to help
put this together.  There may be others as I get more deeply into its de-
sign, but for now I have the following list:

   1.  CDC UT200 emulator

   2.  IBM 2780 emulator

   3.  A DN11 software interface

   4.  A DU11 software interface

   5.  A DF11 software interface

   6.  A faster FORTRAN (I understand the standard UNIX FORTRAN is very slow)

     I understand there is a central collecting place for the various software
packages available under UNIX.  If you can refer me to that place, I will ap-
preciate it.

     It would be a help if I could get back issues of the UNIX working group
notes and publications.  Can you help me in that area?  I would like to be-
come a member of that group.  How do I accomplish this?


     I would appreciate any help and/or names of persons to contact
who may have similar requirements.

                                             Sincerely yours,

                                             Robert L. Mobley

                                             Robert L. Mobley
                                             Director of Computations
