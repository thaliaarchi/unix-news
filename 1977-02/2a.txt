Dear Professor Ferentz:

     We are interested in locating a cross-assembler for Texas
Instruments' 990 microprocessor.  Could you please add this
request to the next UNIX newsletter.

     Your efforts towards better communication between UNIX
users are appreciated.

                                  Sincerely,


                                  Barbara N. Wagner
