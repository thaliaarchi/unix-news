Dear Professor Ferentz:

     I hope you have already received my request to join the UNIX Users
Group.  If not, our purchasing people have it in their queue and if
their scheduler has no bugs you should receive it shortly.

     We are currently running UNIX on a number of systems and have been
pleased with the results.  However, one particular group we support has
been using the Harvard MACRO Assembler with many frustrations.  They are
attempting to assemble large programs heavily loaded with macro calls
which are often embedded in other macros.  In addition to being unable
to obtain cross-references most of the time, they also obtain seemingly
inconsistent errors that are related to the placement of NCALL statements.
The errors are identifiable with older versions of DEC's MACRO which
have since been corrected.  I would certainly appreciate it if you could
ask the users group if anyone has encountered similar results and fixed
the probelms or if another implementation of MACRO is available.  I have
spoken to both Harvard and Johns Hopkins people, but still have not been
able to resolve the problem.

     Thank you for your time and effort.

                                 Sincerely,


                                 Richard C. Bozenski
