Dear "West Coast" Unix User:

A second informal meeting of the still unformed West Coast Unix Users Group
will be hosted by the Computer Science Division on Friday and Saturday,
February 27 and 28 in Berkeley, California.  The timing of the meeting is meant
to coordinate with COMPCON which is being held in San Francisco the 24th to
the 25th.

Features of the meeting will be a talk by Jerry Popek of UCLA about his effort
to put UNIX on top of a security kernel, the latest information from Ken Thomp-
son, a report on the Harvard UNIX system by Chuck Prenner, a talk on a new de-
bugger for both C and assembly languages by Bill Allen of the Naval Postgraduate
School, tours of the Berkeley PDP 11/70, and the two day format to allow greater
informal exchange.  In addition, it is hoped that each attending group will make
a short presentation on their current work.

A block of rooms are being held for us by the Hotel Durant, which is located
next to campus.  The enclosed sheet explains the arrangement.  Note that an
early reply is required to guarantee you of a room.  Please make all housing
arrangements directly with the Hotel Durant.

The meeting will convene in the Hughes Room, 431 Cory Hall, at 10:00 a.m. on
February 27.  A note or call from groups planning to attend is appreciated but
not required.  Please invite any interested persons who are not on the mailing
list.

                                         Sincerely,

                                         Bob Fabry

                                         Professor Robert S. Fabry
