    b.  An ARPAnet interface has been written which uses hardware
        designed at Systems Development Corporation and construc-
        ted at Rand.  This hardware is supposed to be equivalent
        to a device that DEC sells for $8,000 as an IMP-11.  The
        interface (actually a UNIX driver) uses approximately
        10,000 bytes of kernel space--thus, you probably need an
        11/45 or 70 to run it.  Both user and server telnets and
        ftps are implemented in user space.

2.  At the Naval Postgraduate School:

    a.  Ed has been modified to prompt and give line numbers, and
        not to quit (q) until after a write (w) unless the user
        insists.

    b.  A Versatec plotter driver has been written.

    c.  A remote reboot has been implemented.

    d.  A virtual machine monitor has been written (for use as a
        teaching aid).

    e.  The scheduler ������������������������������������������

        �����������������������������������������������������������
        ����������������������������������������. The savings were
        much less (down to 6 percent) when more memory was available.

    f.  They know something about a compilable Fortran developed at
        Princeton.

3.  At UC Berkeley

    a.  A file system fixer has been written that recovers about as
        well as possible from crashes.

    b.  A DL compatible 8 port multiplexer that can be built for
        about $750 has been developed.

    c.  A very distant host interface for the Illinois NCP has been
        developed.  It runs on an 11/40, but there are only about
        40 words left in the kernel space.

    d.  They have linked UNIX to an 11/05 for hands on use (for
        teaching interrupt programming, etc.).  Programs are com-
        piled on an 11/45 and shipped over to the 11/05.
