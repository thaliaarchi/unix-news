     Dear Mel:

     This letter is to confirm that the UNIX Users' Meeting will be held
     at the Science Center, 1 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Mass. in Lecture
     Hall D on the first floor on Thursday and Friday, April 1 and 2, 1976.
     Enclosed is a map and a sketch of the first floor of the Science
     Center showing the hall location.

     For people flying to Boston, the quickest route to Harvard Square
     is to take the airport bus to the airport subway station, take a
     Blue Line train to Government Center, change to the Green Line and
     go to Park Street, then change to the Red Line to Harvard Square.
     Time:  20 to 30 minutes.  The alternative is to take a cab at a cost
     of about $7.00.
