                    RT-11 Fortran under Unix________________________

     We  have  a  modified  version  of  PDP-11  Fortran  IV  (as
described  in DEC-11-LFLBA-B-D) which runs under Unix.  Libraries
are available for all PDP-11 configurations.


     Binary versions may be obtained by any installation with the
Dec binary license.  Source may be obtained by those with the Dec
source license.  A Unix version of the Macro  assembler  is   re-
quired  to  use  the  source code.  Users must make their own ar-
rangements for this.


     The product may be obtained on one RK05  cartridge  or  four
Dectapes.  There is a handling charge of $200, which includes the
cost of the medium.  (Note: delivery time for  Dectapes  will  be
substantially greater than  for RK05 cartridges).
