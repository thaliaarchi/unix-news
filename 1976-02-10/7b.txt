                     WEST COAST UNIX USERS MEETING_____________________________



A meeting of the West Coast UNIX Users was held at the Naval Postgraduate
School, Monterey, California on October 31.  About 20 people attended the
meeting.  The University of California accounted for about half the parti-
cipants, including representatives from the Berkeley, UCLA, and San Diego
campuses.  There were also people from the Stanford Medical School, Data
Disk, Inc. (Sunnyvale, Ca.), the Naval Postgraduate School, and Rand.


The featured speaker was Ken Thompson who is teaching at Berkeley this
year.  Among the things he had to say:

     1.  There is much duplication of effort in the UNIX community.
         He pointed out the existence of a bimonthly newsletter, to
         which the various installations should contribute, and which
         should receive wider circulation within installations.

     2.  DEC will soon announce cheaper and faster replacements for
         the 11/40 and 11/45.  However, the new machines will have
         11/40-style memory mapping, i.e., no split I/D spaces, so
         they won't support large UNIX installations.  Only the 11/70
         will have the required hardware.

     3.  Some of Ken's recent research has been concerned with link-
         ing multiple processors running UNIX.  He has successfully
         linked two such processors.  Thus the shell interprets
         !<command> as a request to run <command> on the foreign machine
         and "cat x > !foo" outputs to file foo on the foreign machine.

     4.  Ken said that the present scheduling algorithm lacks sophisti-
         cation because they could not think of anything better at the
         time.  He believes that he now has a better algorithm, which
         uses short-term averages of compute time to real time to give
         better service to interactive processes at the expense of
         compute-bound processes.

     5.  With regard to efficiency, Ken said that measurements by pro-
         gram-counter sampling with a very high priority clock indicated
         that 15 percent of the time spent in the kernel is used by CSV
         and CRTN, the C language subroutine call and return, which save
         registers.  He suggests that these should be microcoded, at
         least for use by the kernel.

         Measurements also indicated that 10 percent of the kernel time
         is spent in searching the proc table in "swtch," which decides
         which process to run.  He suggests that the proc table should
         be hash coded or that processes in RUN state should be linked
         (cost:  50 words).
