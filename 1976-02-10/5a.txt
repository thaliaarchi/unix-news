Dear Professor Ferentz:

In response to your letter of November 26, 1975, please be advised
that we have no plans to change the language in our standard UNIX
Software Agreement, which is used to license educational institu-
tions for "academic and educational purposes" only.  However, we
have no objections to our UNIX licensees communicating with each
other since the licensee is under the same obligation of confiden-
tiality with respect to the LICENSED SOFTWARE.  You are welcome, if
you so desire, to visit with us here at Western Electric, where we
would be pleased to discuss with you our agreement, as it relates to
your needs.

With regard to your request for a current list of UNIX licensees, I
am providing you with such a list as requested (See attached list).
I will endeavor to provide you with updates to this list periodically.

In conclusion, you did inquire about several Bell System Software
Programs, which are presently not available for licensing.  I have
forwarded your request for these programs to the Bell Telephone
Laboratories.  Should they become available for licensing, I will
contact you.

                                             Very truly yours,

                                             S. Jones for

                                             R. G. SHAHPAZIAN
Att.
