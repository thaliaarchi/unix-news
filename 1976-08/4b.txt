Subject: Floating point simulator in I/D space

    We have found that the floating point simulator package does
not operate properly with I/D space separation.  The difficulty is
cause (1) by fetching the floating point instruction from the
program, and (2) incorrectly interpreting such addressing modes
as immediate and absolute. The changes to fix this require being
able to access the I space as data.  It is our guess that the MFPI
instruction can be used for this purpose. Even so, rather extensive
modifications tothe floating point interpreter are required.  We
would like toknow if anyone else has discoverd this and fixed this problem.

    Also, we find that cdb will not operate properly if floating point
simulation is being used, and have corrected the problem. We would
be glad to let anyone know about this who cares.
