Dear Professor Ferentz:

We have discovered a bug in our C compiler.  Contrary to the statement
on page 16 of the "C Reference Manual", "...The length of the array is
taken to be the maximum of the number of expressions in the list and
the square-bracketed constant in the array's declarator. ...", we found
that, in the case of an array initialized to a character string, the
length of the array was set to the length of the character string, rather
than the greater value in the square brackets.  We have not determined
either the cause of the error or if the same thing occurs on other types
of initialization.

I hope this information is of some use.


Yours,

David M Phillips
