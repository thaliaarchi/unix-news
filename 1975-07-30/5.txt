16K word banks of three ported memory.  UNIX compatible dev-

ice drivers have been developed  for  each  of  these  peri-

pherals.

    To control this diverse hardware suite, we have  evolved

MUNIX, a tightly-coupled symmetric multiprocessor version of

UNIX.  A single copy of the system residing in shared memory

is  executed  by  both  processors  independently.   P and V

operators are used for synchronization.  In order to provide

the  increased  address  space necessary to support the mul-

tiprocessor system, UNIX was modified to seperate  kernel  I

and D space.  In support of the signal acquisition research,

a new process classification,  real-time,  has  been  added.

When  a process is granted real-time status, it is locked in

memory, given the highest priority possible, and preemptive-

ly allocated a processor whenever it comes ready.

    Other completed  work  includes  the  development  of  a

dynamic  symbolic debugging tool having breakpoint capabili-

ty, a rather basic PDP 11 virtual machine monitor which exe-

cutes  under  MUNIX,  several on-line diagnostic packages, a

line editor which facilitates correction of typing mistakes,

system  calls which gracefully stop or bootstrap the system,

and enhancements to the text editor, the text processor, the

C  compiler,  and  the  loader.  Work presently underway in-

cludes a performance measurement subsytem, several  adaptive

schedulers,  a  demand  paged memory manager, and a hardened

file system.

    NPS  developed  software is available as a nine track tp

tape to any Bell Labs approved site.
