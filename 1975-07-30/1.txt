                                   UNIX NEWS

     This mailing is the first "permanent" issue of the UNIX NEWS.  As previous-
ly  announced,  this  will  be a bimonthly. mailed at the end of each odd month,
Where a special issue is warranted, we will include its  contents  in  the  next
regularly numbered issue.  Preceding this issue, there were three mailings.  The
first was the invitation to be placed on the mailing list which is reproduced in
this  issue.   The second was a notice of the June 18th New York meeting and the
Harvard software.  The third was the "special issue" dated  Julw  16  announcing
the new edition of UNIX.

     There were no objections to publishing the mailing list and so we  are  in-
cluding  it in this issue.  The integer part of the sequence number on the first
line corresponds to a list of licensees that Ken Thompson keeps.  The fractional
part  designates  multiple  installations  under a single license.  Since we now
have several such, we will mail a copy of the newsletter to  each,  provided  we
receive a returned copy of the coupon on the invitation to subscribe.

     The original letter went to approximately 76 people, all but 6 of whom  re-
plied.   Subsequent  letters  recently went to 20 new installations and, to date
the mailing list contains 37 names.  Our only communications problems  are  with
locations where the only name is a contracts officer and with multiple installa-
tions.  I would ask each of you to scan the list of names and let me know of any
installations you know of which are not on the list.


                             USER SOFTWARE EXCHANGE

     It is apparent that there is lots of user software under UNIX  that  is  of
general  use  and  this  newsletter's greatest utility is probably in announcing
availability of software.  We invite discussion in this  newsletter  of  general
philosophy  with  respect to licensing, distribution, costs, and the relation of
commercial licensees to software exchange.


                                NEW YORK MEETING

     The meeting on June 18 at the City University of New York was  attended  by
over  40  people from 20 installations.  Each installation described briefly its
function and idiosyncrasies.  We will not try to reproduce them  here  since  we
expect  one  page  write-ups  for  subsequent  inclusion from each installation.
(Several such are included in this issue.) There  was  unanimous  sentiment  for
keeping the users' group and its newsletter as informal as possible.
