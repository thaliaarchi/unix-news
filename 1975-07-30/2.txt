     The next meeting in the East will be October 6 at the  City  University  of
New York and the following meeting in early spring at Harvard.  By October there
should be considerable experience with the new system, and by spring general ex-
perience with the Harvard system.

     Ken Thompson described some of the features of  the  new  system  and  some
benchmarks run on the 11/70.  He estimates the raw cpu gives a factor of 2.5 im-
provement in performance for UNIX, and that with the new peripherals the  factor
is about 3.0.

                             NEW SYSTEM AVAILABLE

     The Sixth Edition - June 1975 of the UNIX system is now available for  dis-
tribution  to  licensees.   Commercial users should contact Western Electric for
details.  Academics can receive the new system for a  service  fee  of  $150.00.
Normal  distribution  is  on  800 bpi - 9 track tape.  You need not send a tape,
Just a check for $150.00 made out to Bell Laboratories, Inc. and sent to:

                         I. B. Biren, Room 2c-548
                         Bell Laboratories, Inc.
                         Computing Information Services Group
                         Murray Hill,  NJ  07974

The tape contains a single file which extracts  to  3  RK-packs  or  equivalent.
These contain:
                Pack0   The system except for /usr/source
                Pack1   /usr/source
                Pack2   Documentation in machine readable form

Those who require distribution on RK-packs should send two or three  packs along
with  their  checks.   The package also includes one hard-copy of each of the 19
documents.

     Among the new "goodies" are:

                1)      Separate I and D space for the resident monitor on
                        11/45s and 11/70s
                2)      Huge files (up to 16 megabytes)
                3)      A preprocessor for structured Fortran
                4)      TMG
                5)      A preprocessor for DC,  with arbitrary precision
                6)      Many fixes and rewrites of system programs from "as"
                        to "c"
                7)      Much improved comments embedded in system source
                8)      More graceful death on running out of resources and
                        other crashes

                            OTHER SOFTWARE AVAILABLE

     The MUNIX paper which starts on page 4 announces the availability of  their
system.   I have a recent note from Professor Allen saying he expects to have it
available in the very near future.
