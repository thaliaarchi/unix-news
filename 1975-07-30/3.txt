     Harvard has  announced  the  availability  in  the  near  future  of  their
software.   It  will be available to other academic institutions for the nominal
cost of reproducing it.  The system is running in a heavy-use  student  environ-
ment  and  they expect to have some documentation by the end of the summer.  For
details write:

                             REQUESTS FOR SOFTWARE

     From P. De Souza, Heriot-Watt University:

          We are interested in getting in touch with UNIX  users  who  may  have
          developed  a  BCPL compiler/interpreter, a driver for a Vector General
          display, or a software link to a PDP-10


                           INSTALLATION DESCRIPTIONS

                           University of Saskatchewan

               PDP11/40 with 48Kw of core (expanding to 64Kw)
               3 terminals (2 more on order)
               1 DC11 dial-up interface and a CDI Teleterm 1030
               2 RK11 disk drives (1 on order)
               1 DH11 on order to replace current line interfaces

     We also have a PDP11/20 with TTY, high speed paper tape and a VT01  display
scope.   This is currently connected to the PDP11/40 by a DL11-E serial line but
will soon be replaced by a DR11-C parallel interface.  One current project is to
write  a  monitor  for  the PDP11/20 so that its peripherals become available to
UNIX users.
