            The  Naval  Postgraduate  School  Signal  Processing and

        Display Laboratory is a  university  laboratory  engaged  in

        research  efforts  in  computer graphics, signal processing,

        operating systems, and hybrid computing.  The laboratory  is

        used  for  student  instruction  as  well as for student and

        faculty research.

            The  configuration  of the Signal Processing and Display

        Laboratory is shown in Figure 1.  The system can  be  viewed

        as  a  three  bus ensemble, with the respective functions of

        data acquisition, signal processing, and display,  When  bus

        cycles  are  not  required  by real-time processes, the data

        acquisition and display busses support  program  development

        activities.   The  display system includes a 256K word fixed

        head disk, a Ramtek color display, a Tektronix 4014  display

        with enhanced graphics, a Vector General 3D system, a Hughes

        Conographic   console,   a   data   tablet,    a    Versatek

        printer/plotter,  and  an EPC graphic recorder.  Peripherals

        for the Data Acquisition controller include both large  (96M

        words)  and small (2.5M words) disk systems, magnetic tapes,

        a card reader, a line printer, and a sixteen line  programm-

        able  terminal  multiplexer.   Dual  ported core memory (88K

        words) is accessible from either UNIBUS.   The  signal  pro-

        cessing  subsystem  consists of a CSP 125 controller with 4K

        words of 125 nanosecond memory, an array processor, and  two

                                    -1-
