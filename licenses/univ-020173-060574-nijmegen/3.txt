                     MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  4.01  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring by

  4.02  This agreement shall prevail notwithstanding any conflicting terms or
legends which may appear in the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

  4.03  WESTERN and its ASSOCIATED COMPANIES make no
representations or warranties, expressly or implicitly. By way of example but
not of limitation, WESTERN and its ASSOCIATED COMPANIES make no
representations or warranties of merchantability or fitness for any particular
purpose, or that the use of the LICENSED SOFTWARE, will not infringe any
patent, copyright or trademark of any third person. WESTERN and its
ASSOCIATED COMPANIES shall not be held to any liability with respect to
any claim by LICENSEE or a third party on account of, or arising from, the
use of such LICENSED SOFTWARE.

  4.04  Neither the execution of this agreement nor anything in it or in the

LICENSEE, any assistance of any kind whatsoever, or any information or
documentation other than the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

  4.05  LICENSEE agrees that it shall hold the LICENSED SOFTWARE in
confidence for WESTERN and its ASSOCIATED COMPANIES. LICENSEE

whom such disclosure is necessary to the use for which rights are granted
hereunder. LICENSEE shall appropriately notify each employee and student to
whom any such disclosure is made that such disclosure is made in confidence
and shall be kept in confidence by him.
