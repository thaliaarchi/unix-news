  Signed by Dick Shahpazian, Director of Patent Licensing, and Dr. C.J.M. Aarts.

  Described on [Dennis Ritchie's site](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/about/dennis-m-ritchie/licenses.html):

  Effective on 1 December 1974, signed by AT&T on 26 February 1975 and by
  Nijmegen on 6 February 1975.

  > Prof. Karl Kleine at Fachhochschule Jena in Germany found and scanned some
  > documents relating to the distribution of early versions of Unix, and kindly
  > made them available.

  > The first (in PDF form) is the license issued to Katholieke Universiteit in
  > Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in December 1974. They were one of the early
  > educational users, and probably the same license was used for all the
  > educational organizations at that time. Despite the name of the file, from
  > the date of the contract, the license probably refers to the Fifth Edition
  > system; the Sixth Edition manual is dated May, 1975. It's quite possible,
  > however, that it was the 6th Edition that was actually delivered.
  >
  > The license is full of boilerplate, but probably the important operative
  > clause is that of 4.05, which effectively allows free use within the
  > university, provided the users do not disclose outside the organization.
  > Section 2.01 grants use "for educational and academic purposes only;" 4.05
  > requires the licensee not to disclose the software "or methods and concepts
  > utilized therein," to anyone except employees or students as necessary for
  > purposes granted. I believe that the wording allowed John Lions to teach his
  > Unix course and prepare his famous Unix commentary, but that the terms were
  > tightened up later to be more restrictive by the time of the Seventh
  > Edition. However, I understand that the restriction against disclosing
  > methods or concepts (as distinct from actual source code) caused ill-ease to
  > some university lawyers. This restriction was indeed a bit peculiar: the
  > concepts had already been published, for example in the C. ACM paper.
  >
  > This license was royalty-free, but there was a $150 administrative fee.

  > UNIX time sharing operating system computer program and supporting programs
