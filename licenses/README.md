## Nijmegen 1974

Dennis Ritchie, 2003

Effective on 1 December 1974, signed by Western on 26 February 1975 and by
Nijmegen on 6 February 1975. The cost was $150.

The provided components are the same as Berkeley's license.

Signed by Dick Shahpazian, Director of Patent Licensing, and Dr. C.J.M. Aarts.

Described by Dennis Ritchie:

> Prof. Karl Kleine at Fachhochschule Jena in Germany found and scanned some
> documents relating to the distribution of early versions of Unix, and kindly
> made them available.
>
> The first (in PDF form) is the license issued to Katholieke Universiteit in
> Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in December 1974. They were one of the early
> educational users, and probably the same license was used for all the
> educational organizations at that time. Despite the name of the file, from
> the date of the contract, the license probably refers to the Fifth Edition
> system; the Sixth Edition manual is dated May, 1975. It's quite possible,
> however, that it was the 6th Edition that was actually delivered.
>
> The license is full of boilerplate, but probably the important operative
> clause is that of 4.05, which effectively allows free use within the
> university, provided the users do not disclose outside the organization.
> Section 2.01 grants use "for educational and academic purposes only;" 4.05
> requires the licensee not to disclose the software "or methods and concepts
> utilized therein," to anyone except employees or students as necessary for
> purposes granted. I believe that the wording allowed John Lions to teach his
> Unix course and prepare his famous Unix commentary, but that the terms were
> tightened up later to be more restrictive by the time of the Seventh
> Edition. However, I understand that the restriction against disclosing
> methods or concepts (as distinct from actual source code) caused ill-ease to
> some university lawyers. This restriction was indeed a bit peculiar: the
> concepts had already been published, for example in the C. ACM paper.
>
> This license was royalty-free, but there was a $150 administrative fee.

## Leuven 1977

> This is the Unix licence signed by K.U.Leuven in September 1977. It allows
> the K.U.Leuven to run Unix V6 (version 6) on the PDP 11/45 of the Unité
> d'Informatique of the Université Catholique de Louvain. (At that time we did
> not have a PDP to run Unix.
