                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
                 EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE AGREEMENT

                    USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE

  1.01  (a) Uses for "academic and educational purposes" means uses
directly related to teaching and degree-granting programs
and uses in noncommercial research by students and faculty
members, including any uses made in connection with the
development of enhancements or modifications to the
LICENSED SOFTWARE, provided that (i) neither the results of
such research nor any enhancement or modification so developed
is intended primarily for the benefit of a third party; (ii) such
results, enhancements and modifications (all to the extent that
they do not include any portion of LICENSED SOFTWARE)
are made available to anyone including AT&T and its associated
companies without restrictions on use, copying or further
distribution, notwithstanding any proprietary right (such as a
copyright or patent right) that could be asserted by LICENSEE,
its students or faculty members and (iii) any copy of any such
result enhancement or modification furnished by LICENSEE is
furnished for no more than the cost of reproduction and shipping.
Any such copy that includes any portion of LICENSED
SOFTWARE may be furnished to others than AT&T and its
associate companies only pursuant to the provisions of Section
4.08(c).

  (b)  Commercial use by LICENSEE of the LICENSED
SOFTWARE or of any such result enhancement or modification
is not permitted under this agreement. Such commercial use is
permissible only pursuant to the terms of an appropriate
commercial software agreement between AT&T and
LICENSEE. Any such result, enhancement or modification may
be developed further by LICENSEE for commercial use such as
by developing software for license or for a third party only on
CPUs covered by such a commercial software agreement and
only provided that the result enhancement or modification in the
form in which it exists when such a commercial software agreement
is executed by LICENSEE, remains available to anyone as
specified in Section 1.01(a).

  1.02  At any time at AT&T'S request, LICENSEE will
furnish in writing to AT&T a description of the use of
LICENSED SOFTWARE sufficient to enable AT&T to verify
that such a use is solely for academic and educational purposes.

  1.03  A single back-up CPU may be used as a substitute for
a DESIGNATED CPU without notice to AT&T during any
time when such a DESIGNATED CPU is inoperative because it
is malfunctioning or undergoing repair, maintenance or other
modifications.

  1.04  No right is granted for the use of LICENSED
SOFTWARE, directly for any third person, or for any use by
any third person of the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

                  ADDITIONAL OR REPLACING CPUs

  2.01  LICENSEE may at any time request in writing that
an additional CPU be made a DESIGNATED CPU or that a
replacing CPU be substituted for a current DESIGNATED
CPU. Any such request must include an identification of each
such CPU by location, type and serial number and a
description of the proposed use of the LICENSED
SOFTWARE on each additional or replacing CPU sufficient
to show that such use will be solely for academic and
educational purposes. Any such requests shall become effective
on agreement thereto in writing by AT&T and receipt by
AT&T of the appropriate service charge.

  2.02  LICENSEE may obtain additional copies of
LICENSED SOFTWARE for use on additional
DESIGNATED CPUs on payment of a distribution charge to
AT&T for each copy. AT&T will quote the amount of
such distribution charge on request.

  2.03  There are different versions of LICENSED
SOFTWARE for different types of CPUs. The Schedule(s)
attached hereto and the version(s) of LICENSED
SOFTWARE to be furnished hereunder are determined
by the type(s) of CPU(s) specified in this agreement. If an
additional CPU of a different type becomes a
DESIGNATED CPU pursuant to Section 2.01 and a
version of LICENSED SOFTWARE for such type is
available from AT&T, AT&T will forward to LICENSEE
an additional Schedule for such version. Within a
reasonable time after such designation becomes effective
and payment for the distribution charges is received,
AT&T or one of its associated companies will furnish to
LICENSEE a copy of such version in the form identified in
such additional Schedule.

                            TERMINATION

  3.01  If LICENSEE shall fail to fulfill one or more of
its obligations under this agreement AT&T may, upon its
election and in addition to any other remedies that it may
have, at any time terminate all the rights granted by it
hereunder by not less than two (2) months written notice
to LICENSEE specifying any such breech, unless within
the period of such notice all breaches specified therein
shall have been remedied; upon such termination
LICENSEE shall within thirty (30) days deliver to AT&T
all documentation containing the LICENSED
SOFTWARE and, shall render unusable all LICENSED
SOFTWARE placed in any storage apparatus.

                     MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  4.01  LICENSEE assures AT&T that it does not intend to
and will not knowingly, without the prior written consent, if
required, of the Office of Export Administration of the U.S.
Department of Commerce, Washington D.C. 20230, transmit
directly or indirectly:

  (i) the LICENSED SOFTWARE; or

 (ii) any immediate product (including processes and services)
      produced directly by the use of the LICENSED SOFTWARE; or

(iii) any commodity produced by such immediate product if
      the immediate product of the LICENSED SOFTWARE
      is a plant capable of producing a commodity or is a major
      component of such plant;

to Afghanistan or to any Group P, Q, S, W, Y or Z country
specified in supplement No. 1 to section 320 of the Export
Administration Regulation issued by the U.S.
Department of Commerce. LICENSEE agrees that its
obligations under this section 4.01 shall survive and
continue after any termination of rights under this
agreement.
