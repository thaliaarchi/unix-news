  Date deduced by [Warner Losh](https://papers.freebsd.org/2020/FOSDEM/losh-Hidden_early_history_of_Unix.files/slides.pdf)
  from "There are two versions of UNIX. The first, which has been in existence
  about a year, runs on the PDP-7 and -9 computers; a more modern version, a few
  months old, uses the PDP-11." UNIX-7 was late 1979 and UNIX-11 was February
  1971, so that puts this document at around spring 1971.
