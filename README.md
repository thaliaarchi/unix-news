# Early UNIX history

A project to transcribe and organize documents relating to early UNIX history,
focusing on the first users before V7, from 1969 to around 1976.

- [UNIX News and ;login:](login/README.md) (1975–2020):
  the USENIX newsletter/magazine, the first newsletter for UNIX
- [Australian UNIX Users Group Newsletter](auugn/README.md) (1978–2004):
  the first Australian newsletter for UNIX
- Many documents relating to [early UNIX users](users/README.md)
- [UNIX manuals](manuals/README.md):
  currently only a manual before V1, re-transcribed with the original whitespace
  and formatting

Other documents to do:
- [The Bell System Technical Journal](https://archive.org/details/bstj-archives?query=unix)
- "UNIX Time-Sharing System: A Retrospective". Dennis Ritchie. Tenth Hawaii
  International Conference on the System Sciences, Honolulu, January 1977

Many thanks to Jonathan Gray for his assistance tracking down sources on early
UNIX users. This project inspired his [unix-licensees](https://github.com/jonathangray/unix-licensees)
project and his, in turn, has broadened my search.
