Dear Mrs. Biren:

          As discussed in our telephone conversation of
July 13, 1976, my department wishes to acquire a copy of
the UNIX Time-Sharing System.  We wish to have our own
copy of UNIX, independent of any other departments of
this university which also run UNIX.  We are prepared to
pay the required service charge for a separate agreement.

          The computer on which our UNIX system would be
run is a Digital Equipment PDP 11/455, with C.P.U. serial
number 866.  This computer is located at the following
address:


               158 University Avenue West
               Waterloo, Ontario, Canada

          There are no room numbers in this building.
The person with signing authority in our department who
will be responsible for the system is Professor
J.W. Graham, Director of the Computer Systems Group.



                                                  .../2
