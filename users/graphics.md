# Graphics uses of UNIX

- [*Proceedings of SIGGRAPH '74*](https://dblp.org/db/conf/siggraph/siggraph1974.html),
  15–17 July 1974

  [Bell Labs, Holmdel](holmdel.md) was presumably not yet using UNIX for
  graphics.

  No papers mention UNIX, but several mention PDP-11s.

  Note that the papers from this conference were published in Computers &
  Graphics, available via ScienceDirect, and are not linked from the
  proceedings, so need to be individually searched.

    Discusses implementations at other universities, including Utah and Case
    Western. Case Western has an Evans & Sutherland Shaded Graphic System which
    runs with a PDP-11, but they use Algol, so it sounds to not be UNIX.

    > During the past several years, films from the University of Utah (16),
    > General Electric Corp. (17) and by N. Max (18), illustrate that the
    > ability to produce 3-D shaded object animation has been a significant
    > addition to the field of computer animation. Max's comment about his film,
    > "Sphere Eversion," describes the basic feeling towards this type of
    > animation: "The film produces a visualization which could not have been
    > achieved in any other medium, and could never have been animated by hand."

    > Based on the literature to date, there have been many computer graphics
    > facilities which have implemented either a technique for generating 3-D
    > objects, an animation language, or a visible surface algorithm. Two
    > examples would be the University of Utah which produced the Watkins
    > Algorithm (31,33), and Archuleta's work at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
    > (2) where he implemented a fast version of the Watkins Algorithm on a
    > CDC 7600. However, only a few facilities have attempted to integrate these
    > fundamental capabilities into one complete system for the expressed
    > purpose of animation.

    > Case Western Reserve University has a computer system which can generate
    > shaded perspective pictures in real time. This "Shaded Graphic System" was
    > developed for Case by Evans and Sutherland Corporation at a cost $400,000.
    > It consists of a graphics processor driving a pipeline of special purpose
    > hardware for matrix multiplication and shading. Sharing memory with the
    > graphics processor is a PDP-11 with a 10 megabyte disk and an assortment
    > of I/O devices. 3-D data is processed on a scan line by scan line basis by
    > a hardware implementation of Watkin's hidden surface algorithm and sent to
    > a shader which uses the Gouraud shading technique (21). The resulting
    > image is displayed on a raster scan CRT for real-time display. A camera
    > unit with color filters under computer control is used to produce computer
    > animated films.

    > Jones (22) describes a high level programming language he implemented for
    > the Case system. It consists of a complete implementation, for the PDP 11,
    > of Algol-60 with the addition of string variables, I/O facilities, and
    > extensions for handling graphic shaded images. The primary purpose of this
    > work was to facilitate the use of a custom-built system which can produce
    > shaded images in real time. According to Jones one important advantage of
    > Algol was its block structure which Jones decided would lend itself quite
    > nicely to the description of graphical structures. The consequence of this
    > approach is that just as Algol itself is a way of talking about
    > algorithms, the graphic-extended Algol is a way of talking about graphical
    > data structures. [page 56]

    Uses Evans & Sutherland Picture System.

    > graphics system and a numerically controlled three axis milling machine.
    > The graphics system is an Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation PICTURE
    > SYSTEM, driven by a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/45. User
    > interaction with the graphics system is primarily through the use of
    > function switches, control dials and a tablet. The actual milling of the

    > numerically controlled three axis milling machine. To supplement the
    > milling machines control panel and act as a front end processor, a
    > Tektronix 4051 Graphic System has been interfaced to the TRIMAC
    > mini-computer controller. For obtaining high resolution hard copy plots at
    > various stages of the design process, there is a large (4'x8') XYNETICS
    > flat bed plotter which is controlled off line by magnetic tape.

    > The central processor is a PDP-11/45 with full complement of memory and
    > several large disk storage modules. Almost all of the motion analysis
    > software is resident on this machine. The MC6800 processor is used as
    > slave to the 11/45. It functions as an intelligent controller to the video
    > disk, which stores in analogue form the raw video images of the entity
    > under study. Computer synthesized images from the 11/45 are produced by
    > the SPIWRIT graphics processor, described in more detail in section V. The
    > images from the video disk and SPIWRIT are fed into a simple video mixing
    > unit which superimposes the SPIWRIT images on the raw video images. The
    > images are then displayed for the user to see on a standard colour
    > television display screen. The digitizing tablet is used by the
    > interactive user to give commands to the system and to make sketches.
    >
    > Basic system software has been written for all of the hardware components
    > under the UNIX operating system (Bell 1978). The SPIWRIT display is
    > supported by a general-purpose device-independent graphics package called
    > GPAC (Reeves 1978). GPAC also supports a generalized event-driven input
    > mechanism and sketching software for the digitizing tablet. The MC6800
    > video disk controller sub-system allows the 11/45 to instruct the
    > controller to play back asynchronously a sequence of frames at a given
    > rate. The controller returns a message to the 11/45 when it has finished.
    > The trickiest part of the system software is ensuring that the motion
    > analysis system can run in real-time without severely impacting other
    > timesharing users of UNIX. [page 193]
