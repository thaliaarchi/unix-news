# Graphics uses of UNIX

- [*Proceedings of SIGGRAPH '81*](https://archive.org/details/siggraph81confer15sigg),
  3–7 August 1981

  UNIX was used for graphics work at Bell Labs at Murray Hill, University of
  Minnesota, Brown University, University of Toronto, and Bell Labs at Holmdel.

    > The algorithm described in Tables I and II was implemented in the C
    > Language under the UNIX operating system. It was run on a PDP11/45
    > computer with a Ramtek 9300 display. [page 34]

    > To demonstrate the feasibility of the processing scheme, simulation
    > programs were written by the author using the language "C" under the UNIX
    > operating system on a DEC PDP-11/45 at the Image Processing Center,
    > University of Minnesota. Film output was recorded on a Discomed film
    > recorder. [page 61]

    > Our document system is implemented under UNIX on a timeshared VAX 11/780.
    > The graphics display is a Ramtek 9400 graphics system with a 1280 x 1024 x
    > 8 frame buffer, affording high image resolution. The belief, however, that
    > more powerful, less expensive hardware can eventually be packaged to be
    > about the size of a book has been a fundamental motivating force behind
    > the project. [page 182]

    > The central processor is a PDP-11/45 with full complement of memory and
    > several large disk storage modules. Almost all of the motion analysis
    > software is resident on this machine. The MC6800 processor is used as
    > slave to the 11/45. It functions as an intelligent controller to the video
    > disk, which stores in analogue form the raw video images of the entity
    > under study. Computer synthesized images from the 11/45 are produced by
    > the SPIWRIT graphics processor, described in more detail in section V. The
    > images from the video disk and SPIWRIT are fed into a simple video mixing
    > unit which superimposes the SPIWRIT images on the raw video images. The
    > images are then displayed for the user to see on a standard colour
    > television display screen. The digitizing tablet is used by the
    > interactive user to give commands to the system and to make sketches.
    >
    > Basic system software has been written for all of the hardware components
    > under the UNIX operating system (Bell 1978). The SPIWRIT display is
    > supported by a general-purpose device-independent graphics package called
    > GPAC (Reeves 1978). GPAC also supports a generalized event-driven input
    > mechanism and sketching software for the digitizing tablet. The MC6800
    > video disk controller sub-system allows the 11/45 to instruct the
    > controller to play back asynchronously a sequence of frames at a given
    > rate. The controller returns a message to the 11/45 when it has finished.
    > The trickiest part of the system software is ensuring that the motion
    > analysis system can run in real-time without severely impacting other
    > timesharing users of UNIX. [page 193]

    > The entire test-bed is coded in the C language and has been tested on two
    > machines (a PDP-11/45 and a VAX-11/780) running the UNIX operating system.
    > Because C allows the programmer to declare variables as either 16 or 32
    > bit integers independently of machine word length, identical code will run
    > on either machine. We do find, however, that the larger addressing space
    > of the 32 bit machine is necessary for conducting any really useful work.
