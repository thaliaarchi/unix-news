UNIX licensees by institution and version. Ken's license number is only listed
for an institution's first version acquired. I assume that Ken's license number
was ordered by date and that any dates conflicting with that order are
imprecise.

  UNIX acquired in fall 1974:

  > For the purpose of student and faculty research at the Naval Postgraduate
  > School in the Computer Science and Signal Processing disciplines, computer
  > hardware and software was purchased in the fall of 1974. The purchase
  > consisted of two PDP 11/50 processors manufactured by Digital Equipment
  > Corporation, a CSP 30 processor made by Computer Signal Processors
  > Incorporated, discs, terminals, graphics display devices, various types of
  > primary memory, and other peripherals (See Fig 1).
  >
  > The ultimate goal of this relatively large system was to integrate all the
  > components specifically to support signal processing research. When the
  > entire system is not devoted to the real time realm of signal processing, it
  > will be used as a tool by students and faculty involved in computer science
  > related activities such as software engineering research. An agreement with

  News list. It is generated with the `nmrc` shell script in V6. See Jonathan

  > There were no objections to publishing the mailing list and so we are

  Any installations which did not respond to the letter were removed from the
  list, creating the gaps in the Ken's sequence numbers. The highest number in
  the sequence is 51, which matches Ken's list from a month prior, so it is
  unlikely there were any new licensees since then.

  UNIX V4 was shipped to the University in October 1973. Although they had a
  PDP-9, it apparently never ran UNIX-7.

  > drive was added in 1972. The software include the DOS-9 operating system,

  > and an editor. The PDP-9 was used for a large number of small projects as
  > well as for Wayne Davis's research in image processing. This research was
  > moved to the PDP-11/60 in 1977. When the PDP-9 was purchased the Hour Meter
  > registered 6 634 hours. When it was sold as surplus in 1980 the Hour Meter
  > was at 15 993 hours.

  Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix: From AT&T-Owned to Freely Redistributable \
  Marshall Kirk McKusick, January 1999

  - January 1974: Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics Departments
    jointly acquired V4 after Fabry attended SOSP'73.
  - Spring 1974: Profs. Eugene Wong and Michael Stonebraker purchased a
    PDP-11/40 running V5.
  - Fall 1975: Ken Thompson, Jeff Schriebman, and Bob Kridle brought up V6 on a
    newly arrived PDP-11/70.
  - Early 1978: Prof. Richard Fateman acquired a VAX-11/780 and UNIX/32V.

  > Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie presented the first Unix paper at the
  > Symposium on Operating Systems Principles at Purdue University in
  > November 1973. Professor Bob Fabry, of the University of California at
  > Berkeley, was in attendance and immediately became interested in obtaining a

  This claims that this is "believed to be the first use of UNIX outside of
  AT&T", but Ken lists Columbia before Alberta. This appears to be rephrased
  from "The fourth edition of UNIX was shipped to the University in October
  1973; it is believed to be the first version of UNIX used outside of AT&T"
  [Smillie 1991], which refers to V4 not to Alberta, so this may be
  unintentional.

  1989 with only minor edits and extends it to 2013. "UNIX installed" is added
  to the 1973 entry:

  Patrick Louis, 4 June 2017

  The first source license was sold in 1975, to UIUC for UNIX V5. Berkeley
  obtained UNIX V5 in 1974.
