# Lists of UNIX users

- UNIX News [July 16, 1975](https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2023-October/029087.html):
  49 UNIX licensees

  The number of worldwide UNIX licenses [[Hendrik-Jan Thomassen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boahlBmc-NY&t=2434s)
  at 41:06]:
  > Circulation 49 [page 1]

  This letter was one year after KU Nijmegen received their copy [at 41:18].

- UNIX News [July 30, 1975](https://archive.org/details/unix_news_july-30-1975),
  pages 9–11: 37 members listed and at least 51 UNIX licenses

  The number of UNIX News members:
  > Circulation 37 [page 1]

  > There were no objections to publishing the mailing list and so we are
  > including it in this issue.  The integer part of the sequence number on the
  > first line corresponds to a list of licensees that Ken Thompson keeps.  The
  > fractional part designates multiple installations under a single license.
  > Since we now have several such, we will mail a copy of the newsletter to
  > each, provided we receive a returned copy of the coupon on the invitation to
  > subscribe.
  >
  > The original letter went to approximately 76 people, all but 6 of whom
  > replied.  Subsequent letters recently went to 20 new installations and, to
  > date the mailing list contains 37 names.  Our only communications problems
  > are with locations where the only name is a contracts officer and with
  > multiple installations.  I would ask each of you to scan the list of names
  > and let me know of any installations you know of which are not on the list.

  Presumably, any installations which did not respond to the letter were removed
  from the list, creating the gaps in the Ken's sequence numbers. The highest
  number in the sequence is 51, though there could be more. Presumably, the
  count from two weeks prior did not include the two Bell Labs installations
  (0.1 and 0.2) and two new licenses were added.
