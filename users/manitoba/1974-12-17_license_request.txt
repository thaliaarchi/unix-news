Dear Mr. Shahpazian:

The conditions laid out in your December 12 letter concerning
license arrangements for UNIX are quite acceptable to us.
Further, our hardware configuration is more than adequate.

Please send me the appropriate forms as soon as possible.  The
address of the data centre will be:

                      Computer Science Department
                      Room 139 N.E.M.P. Building
                      University of Manitoba

We have heard good reports on UNIX and are very excited about
using it.
                                                 Sincerely,
