  > Since speed is so important, all fill programs at NYIT have been implemented
  > as in-line assembly code, subroutine calls being too costly. The much used
  > 8-bit simple fill was implemented to fill two pixels (a word) at a time
  > instead of just one (a byte) to exploit the speed advantage of the Digital
  > Equipment Corporation PDP11 family of processors and the Evans and
  > Sutherland frame buffers in word mode. Although the connectivity checks are
  > quite a bit more elaborate in word mode, the resulting speedup was worth the
  > ceding trouble. Tne tint fill program was speeded up substantially by
  > checking for the case where it must fill large full-value areas and doing
  > the highly optimized simple fill in that event.

  > A large array of equipment has been assembled to support the NYIT effort. A
  > DEC PDP-11/70 and PDP-11/45 run UNIX operating systems for time-sharing use
  > and output to several Tektronix 4014 storage-tube graphic terminals. A
  > PDP-11/35 is used with an Evans and Sutherland picture system on a stand-alone
  > basis, and several Evans & Sutherland frame buffer systems are in use for
  > temporary picture storage and image playback. A two-inch videotape editing
  > machine has been modified to snap frames from the frame-buffer memories for
  > full-color playback of animated sequences via videotape production. Finally, a
  > high-resolution CRT coupled with a 35mm animation camera is available for
  > recording images directly on film. [page 386]

  The Computer Graphics lab started after November 1974.

  > In 1974, Catmull earned his doctorate in computer science,[1] and was hired
  > by a company called Applicon. By November of that year, he had been
  > contacted by Alexander Schure, the founder of the New York Institute of
  > Technology, who offered him the position as the director of the institute's
  > new Computer Graphics Lab.[19] [20] In that position, in 1977, he invented
  > Tween, software for 2D animation that automatically produced frames of
  > motion in between two frames.[21]
