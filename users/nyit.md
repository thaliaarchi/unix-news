  > Since speed is so important, all fill programs at NYIT have been implemented
  > as in-line assembly code, subroutine calls being too costly. The much used
  > 8-bit simple fill was implemented to fill two pixels (a word) at a time
  > instead of just one (a byte) to exploit the speed advantage of the Digital
  > Equipment Corporation PDP11 family of processors and the Evans and
  > Sutherland frame buffers in word mode. Although the connectivity checks are
  > quite a bit more elaborate in word mode, the resulting speedup was worth the
  > ceding trouble. Tne tint fill program was speeded up substantially by
  > checking for the case where it must fill large full-value areas and doing
  > the highly optimized simple fill in that event.

  The Computer Graphics lab started after November 1974.

  > In 1974, Catmull earned his doctorate in computer science,[1] and was hired
  > by a company called Applicon. By November of that year, he had been
  > contacted by Alexander Schure, the founder of the New York Institute of
  > Technology, who offered him the position as the director of the institute's
  > new Computer Graphics Lab.[19] [20] In that position, in 1977, he invented
  > Tween, software for 2D animation that automatically produced frames of
  > motion in between two frames.[21]
