    Dr A.C. Hearn
    Chairman
    Computer Science Department
    University of Utah
    Salt Lake City, Utah 84112

    Dear Tony:

              I hereby tender my resignation from the Computer Science
    Department, effective June 30, 1977.

              It is with some sadness that I take this action.  The 4½
    years I have been at Utah have been happy years; and my two years as
    a faculty member have been extremely educational and rewarding.
    Nevertheless, I do feel that at this stage in my career I would be
    more appropriately placed in a technical research and development
    organization.  I shall be joining Xerox PARC in July of this year.

              I would like to thank you, and the University of Utah, for
    a thoroughly enjoyable period here.

                                       Sincerely,

                                       {signature: Martin E. Newell}

                                       Martin E. Newell
                                       Assistant Professor of Computer Science.
