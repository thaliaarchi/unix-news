## Research questions

I'm a PhD student in computer science. We recently discovered a tape here in the
MEB from early 1974, that contains the only surviving copy of UNIX V4, the
earliest version of the UNIX operating system to be publicly released. I am
researching our early involvement with UNIX circa 1973–1977 to write an article
which will be released in December once we've digitized it.

My priority is to learn why we first obtained UNIX (e.g., our connection to
SOSP'73 where it was first announced) and what we did with it (e.g., was it used
for graphics? was it an ARPANET node?). I have a good idea of when we acquired
it from tracking down other universities' license agreements with Western
Electric, but I want to find ours. I know Martin Newell obtained it, but he
doesn't remember it; this may indicate not much was thought of this first
version, so locating these materials could prove difficult.

## Timeline

A more concrete UNIX-in-graphics timeline is forming:

- We get V4 in 1974 and it's unsuitable and quickly forgotten.
- In 1977, UNIX and C were as new as Carbon is now. That's enough time for early
  adopters to build off of it.
- The first uses of UNIX in the Computer Graphics conference were in 1976 in
  Bell Labs and 1977 outside. It was becoming popular in graphics.
- A UNIX driver was created for the Evans & Sutherland Picture System 2 between
  May 1977 and October 1978.
- Ed Catmull started the graphics group at NYIT in November 1974, so their
  parallel use of UNIX may have developed from the Zeitgeist, not Utah.
