## Research questions

I'm a PhD student in computer science. We recently discovered a tape here in the
MEB from early 1974, that contains the only surviving copy of UNIX V4, the
earliest version of the UNIX operating system to be publicly released. I am
researching our early involvement with UNIX circa 1973–1977 to write an article
which will be released in December once we've digitized it.

My priority is to learn why we first obtained UNIX (e.g., our connection to
SOSP'73 where it was first announced) and what we did with it (e.g., was it used
for graphics? was it an ARPANET node?). I have a good idea of when we acquired
it from tracking down other universities' license agreements with Western
Electric, but I want to find ours. I know Martin Newell obtained it, but he
doesn't remember it; this may indicate not much was thought of this first
version, so locating these materials could prove difficult.
