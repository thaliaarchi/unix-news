  A United States Army training video (25 minutes) for a Node Site Coordinator
  working with the ARPANET. It has been digitized from VHS. It looks to be from
  the '80s.

  The Defense Data Network (DDN) is a network of networks and has more than
  60,000 terminal and host users. It consists of MILNET, which carries
  unclassified data for DoD and other governmental and non-governmental
  agencies, and DISNET, SCINET, and WINCS, which carry classified data. The
  Defense Communications Agency also manages a fifth subnet, ARPANET, which is
  not part of the DDN.

  The network is made up of terminals, access controllers, Packet Switching
  Nodes (PSN), Inter-Switch Trunks (IST), host computers, and Monitoring
  Centers.
  - An access controller allows multiple terminals to connect to the network at
    a single point. It divides data from terminals and hosts into packets, which
    are then transmitted to PSNs.
  - Packet Switching Nodes. Every node site has a PSN managed by a node site
    coordinator.
  - PSNs send and receive packets via the Inter-Switch Trunks. When an IST is
    down, PSNs redirect packets to alternate routes.
  - Monitoring Centers detect and correct problems that cannot be automatically
    corrected. Every DDN network has at least one Monitoring Center. Node site
    coordinators assist troubleshooting.

  More details on the node and its equipment, PSNs, TACs, ISTs and modems, is
  given at 5:35 after the high-level overview.
