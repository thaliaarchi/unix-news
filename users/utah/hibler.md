  Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix: From AT&T-Owned to Freely Redistributable \
  Marshall Kirk McKusick, January 1999

  UCB was awarded a DARPA contract to develop a system for DARPA's needs,
  including networking.

  > Meanwhile, in the offices of the planners for the Defense Advanced Research
  > Projects Agency (DARPA), discussions were being held that would have a major
  > influence on the work at Berkeley. One of DARPA's early successes had been

  > be replaced. The heaviest cost of replacement was the porting of the

  Mike Hibler was involved in 4.3BSD-Reno development:

  > Meanwhile, development continued on the base system. The virtual memory
  > system whose interface was first described in the 4.2BSD architecture
  > document finally came to fruition. […] we went with our second choice, which
  > was to incorporate the virtual memory system from the MACH operating system
  > done at Carnegie-Mellon University. Mike Hibler at the University of Utah
  > merged the core technology from MACH with the user interface described by
  > the 4.2BSD architecture manual (which was also the interface used by SunOS).
