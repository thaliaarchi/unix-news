  > **Resource Requirements**

  >    The images shown in this paper were all generated
  > on a PDP-11/45 computer having a 256K-byte random
  > access frame buffer which was used as the depth buffer.
  > The main routines were written in Fortran and the
  > critical parts were written in assembly language. The
  > computation time of the extended subdivision algo-
  > rithm is roughly proportional to the area covered by
  > visible objects. Images of nontextured objects of
  > the type used in this paper take about 25 minutes. The
  > addition of texture or reflection increases this time by
  > about l0 percent. All images have a resolution of
  > 512×512 picture elements.

  > The main computer used to produce the calculations is a DEC PDP 11/55. This
  > computer interfaces with the two graphics display systems. For vector
  > graphics, we used an Evans and Sutherland (E&S) Picture System which has
  > special-purpose hardware for rapid three-dimensional transformations, such
  > as translation, scaling, rotation, and viewing in perspective. Even with
  > this sophisticated equipment, in many instances, the hardware did not have
  > sufficient numeric precision to represent the large range of numbers
  > encountered in astronomical phenomena, therefore, extra software was
  > necessary to allow more accurate simulations. The raster output device we
  > used was another E&S product called a digital frame buffer which consists of
  > a large computer memory. One unit of memory (a "byte") is associated with
  > each pixel to be displayed on a screen. As the main computer calculates
  > values and stores them into the frame buffer, a subsidiary microprocessor
  > continuously reads the memory and synthesizes a conventional video signal
  > which is displayed on a CONRAC monitor. Our frame buffer stores 512 lines of
  > 512 pixels each, equivalent to 256,000 pixels. Only 480 lines are displayed.

  A camera records frames displayed on a screen.

  > The teapot was originally designed by my thesis advisor, Martin Newell, who
  > is a computer scientist from England. When Martin Newell wanted some objects
  > with which to sho off his computer programs, he picked a tea service: a
  > teapot, a teacup, and a teaspoon. (I think he had an actual tea set at home
  > that he used for inspiration and for the general shape, but the images were
  > not reproductions.) The original teapot shape which was made was taller than
  > the one in this picture. This is because one day some people came by who
  > were interested in funding our research, so to demonstrate how the changes
  > could be made in the image by stretching it and scaling it, we shrunk the
  > set by a factor of about three quarters, and decided it looked better that
  > way.

  > Let's begin with something I've been thinking about
  > for some time. When I was young I collected stamps;
  > now I collect algorithms for drawing circles. (I also col-
  > lect empty margarine tubs, but that's another story.) It's
  > traditional at this time to drag in the ancient Greeks
  > and mention how they considered the circle the most
  > perfect shape and all that. But it is interesting to see
  > how many essentially different algorithms one can find
  > for drawing them.

  James F. Blinn \
  IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, March 1988, p.16-23

  > Since it’s almost Easter, I thought I would take this
  > opportunity to write about the world’s largest Easter
  > egg. The egg was designed, fabricated, and erected by
  > Ron Resch with the assistance of his student Robert
  > McDermott at the University of Utah. I became
  > involved for a time near the end of the project and
  > learned several interesting lessons in geometric model-
  > ing and numerical analysis, which I will pass on here. I
  > will also point out some as yet unsolved problems con-
  > cerning the geometry of some of Resch’s dome struc-
  > tures. More details can be found in McDermott’s thesis,
  > Geometric Modelling in Computer Aided Design, Uni-
  > versity of Utah, Computer Science Dept., March 1980
  > (available from University Microfilms, 300 N.Zeeb Rd.,
  > Ann Arbor, MI 48106).

  > **The problem** \
  > Why an Easter egg, you might ask? Well, it seems
  > there’s a town in Alberta, Canada, just east of Edmon-
  > ton, named Vegreville, which has a large Ukrainian
  > population. The town fathers wanted to build a monu-
  > ment in the local park, which would symbolize their
  > culture and bring recognition to the town. The Ukrain-
  > ians are well known for their very elaborate decoration
  > of Easter eggs. So what better way to commemorate
  > their cultural heritage than to build a permanent,
  > three-story high, monumental sculpture of a n Easter
  > egg. Now, egg builders are not easy to find, yet after
  > months of looking the town council ultimately became
  > connected with Ron Resch (then a professor at the Uni-
  > versity of Utah and now with Evans & Sutherland as a
  > consultant) who had been working on novel dome
  > structures.
