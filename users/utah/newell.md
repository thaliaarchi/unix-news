## UNIX

- "UNIX V4 DIST" \
  Magnetic tape

  On the side of the tape is a blue label with embossed white text reading
  "UNIX V4 DIST".

  On the front is a white sticker label with handwritten text:
  > UNIX Original \
  > from Bell Labs V4 \
  > (See Manual for format)

  On the reverse is a white sticker label with printed text reading
  "7207 04 031 81" (somewhat unclear). TODO: Take a better photo.

  The tape was found at the end of July 2025 by Aleks Maricq among the files of
  Jay Lepreau in the Flux Research Lab in the Merrill Engineering Building at
  the University of Utah. Rob Ricci, a former student of Jay, says that the
  handwriting on the white label is Jay's.

- [Letter from Ken Thompson to Martin E. Newell](1974-05-31_ken_letter.jpg) \
  31 May 1974

  Presumably, the UNIX V4 distribution was sent in June 1974, shortly after this
  letter.

  > I am sorry for the delay in delivering UNIX.  Unfortunately we've run out of
  > copies of documentation.  As soon as a new batch comes from the printers I
  > will send you the system.

  This letter was found on 1 December 2025 by Aleks Maricq among the documents
  from Jay Lepreau's filing cabinet, sandwiched between travel documents from
  the '90s and a receipt for coffee and donuts.

  > Another rather more conventional system is also under development at Utah.
  > This is based on a PDP-11/45 system.  As proposed, the PDP-11 will have
  > attached to it a real-time line drawing system and a frame buffer.  The line
  > drawing system will be used not only to produce line drawings, but will be
  > capable of carrying out a number of the more commonly needed functions found
  > in processing three dimensional information.  These include matrix
  > multiplication and the ability to clip polygons with an arbitrary number of
  > edges.  The frame buffer will be configured so as to be accessible from the
  > PDP-11 as 128K of high speed store.  Thus, when not used for refreshing a TV
  > monitor, the frame buffer will give a large memory expansion to the PDP-11
  > for storing data structures or whatever else seems appropriate. The whole
  > system will be connected to the ARPA Network as a host.  For interaction,
  > the system will initially have a teletype and tablet.  Hard copy listings
  > and drawings will be obtained by using existing facilities.  It is proposed
  > to connect the head mounted display to this system, using a derivative of
  > the Twinklebox for determining head position and for 3-D input.  When
  > operational, this system will provide facilities for working interactively
  > with line drawings, and for producing direct-view shaded pictures.
