         Another rather more conventional system is also
    under development  at Utah.  This is based on a PDP-
    11/45  system.   As  proposed, the PDP-11 will have
    attached to it a real-time line drawing system and a
    frame  buffer.  The line drawing system will be used
    not  only  to  produce  line  drawings,  but will be
    capable of carrying out a number of the more common-
    ly needed functions found in processing three dimen-
    sional  information.   These  include  matrix multi-
    plication  and  the ability to clip polygons with an
    arbitrary number of edges.  The frame buffer will be
    configured so as to be accessible from the PDP-11 as
    128K  of  high speed store.  Thus, when not used for
    refreshing  a TV monitor, the frame buffer will give
    a  large  memory expansion to the PDP-11 for storing
    data  structures or whatever else seems appropriate.
    The  whole system will be connected to the ARPA Net-
    work  as  a  host.  For interaction, the system will
    initially  have  a  teletype  and tablet.  Hard copy
    listings  and  drawings  will  be  obtained by using
    existing  facilities.  It is proposed to connect the
    head mounted display to this system, using a deriva-
    tive of the Twinklebox for determining head position
    and  for  3-D  input.  When operational, this system
    will  provide  facilities  for working interactively
    with  line  drawings,  and for producing direct-view
    shaded pictures.
