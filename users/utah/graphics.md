  Covers the people involved in graphics work at Utah in the '60s and '70s,
  shows many clips of their work, and gives a brief chronology.

  SIGGRAPH '79, 1 August 1979, pages 253–159

  > On a PDP 11/34, the u-v map takes approximately 4 minutes to compute for the
  > sample surface. [page 256]

- ["PICTUREBALM: A Lisp-Based Graphics Language System with Flexible Syntax and Hierarchical Data Structure"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800250.807475) \
  Gary B. Goates, Martin L. Griss, and Gary J. Herron \
  University of Utah \
  SIGGRAPH '80, 1 July 1980, pages 93–99

  A Lisp for graphics, implemented by adding graphics operators to the P-code
  abstract stack machine. UNIX not mentioned.

  > PICTUREBALM is a portable, interactive, LISP-based language system for
  > graphics applications programing. PICTUREBALM's design and initial
  > experimental implementation is described from the point of view of both the
  > user and the language system implementor. The approach of extending a
  > LISP-based language by adding graphical operations was chosen because many
  > of the recognized requirements for graphics programing languages are
  > standard features of LISP-like systems. Future work is proposed.

  > BALM [6] is a portable, easily extensible, interactive, LISP-based language
  > system. BALM's data structures, dynamic storage management, and resident
  > incremental compiler are essentially those of LISP [7], but BALM is
  > ALGOL-like in its syntax. The close match between these features and the
  > requirements for good graphics programing environments motivated extending
  > BALM into a graphics language. The Utah version of BALM is implemented in
  > terms of a pseudo-code, or "P-code", abstract stack machine, called MTLISP
  > [5]. MTLISP is written in the highly portable BIL language [4] which is
  > translated into FORTRAN or target machine assembly language. PICTUREBALM was
  > developed by adding about a dozen low-level graphics functions as new MTLISP
  > P-code operations, and then making them easily accessible by means of the
  > extension mechanisms built into the BALM system. In particular,
  > PICTUREBALM's parsing was extended by adding new operators for graphics.
