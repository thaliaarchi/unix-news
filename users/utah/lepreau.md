  > Jay’s career at the University of Utah spanned more than a quarter century.
  > In 1980, he joined the Department of Computer Science as an undergraduate
  > student and programmer, under the direction of Randy Frank. After earning
  > his degree in 1983, Jay became the manager of the systems programming group.
  > He helped introduce Utah to UNIX, and by 1987, Jay was the acting head of
  > the department’s computing facility which included 100 or so HP, Apollo, and
  > Sun workstations as well as a few “legacy” VAX computers.
  >
  > In the late 1980s, Jay received funding from Hewlett-Packard to port BSD
  > UNIX to HP workstations, leading to the first release of “HP BSD 4.3”
  > in 1988. Jay became the Assistant Director of the department’s Center for
  > Software Science (CSS) in 1990, where he and his staff continued to receive
  > funding to work on systems software such as the GNU compiler tools and the
  > Mach operating system. The work quickly shifted from engineering to
  > research, and in 1994, Jay received his first major ARPA contract to
  > investigate “Fast and Flexible Mach-based Systems.” Also in 1994, Jay served
  > as the program chair for the first-ever OSDI symposium, which he conceived
  > and founded---and which has become one of the premier venues for systems
  > research. In 1995, Jay renamed his group as the Flux Operating Systems
  > Project. The Flux Group was born!
