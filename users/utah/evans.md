      build and operate a real time shaded picture operating system", Proposal
      No. 73-08-01, 9 August 1973

      Unsolicited proposal by E&S for E&S and the University to build a
      real-time shaded picture operating system. The University would obtain a
      state-of-the art graphics facility and E&S would be provided access.
      Acknowledges the University's ARPA sponsored research and the location of
      E&S on campus.

      The groups are joined by computer graphics pioneers: "Martin Newell of
      Cambridge, England, who has been an important developer of the shaded
      picture art and who has made some of the finest pictures has joined the
      University; Rodney Rougelot, Robert Shumacker and Ed Wild who built the
      first dynamic shaded picture system while employed by the General Electric
      Company have joined Evans & Sutherland. As a result of this gathering
      together in Salt Lake City there is no group of people of comparable
      achievement in the field at any other location."

      The facility operates under a PDP-11/45, which is interfaced by the
      University to the PDP-10 and the ARPANET.
