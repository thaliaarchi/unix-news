      Unsolicited proposal by E&S for E&S and the University to build a
      real-time shaded picture operating system. The University would obtain a
      state-of-the art graphics facility and E&S would be provided access.
      Acknowledges the University's ARPA sponsored research and the location of
      E&S on campus.

      The groups are joined by computer graphics pioneers: "Martin Newell of
      Cambridge, England, who has been an important developer of the shaded
      picture art and who has made some of the finest pictures has joined the
      University; Rodney Rougelot, Robert Shumacker and Ed Wild who built the
      first dynamic shaded picture system while employed by the General Electric
      Company have joined Evans & Sutherland. As a result of this gathering
      together in Salt Lake City there is no group of people of comparable
      achievement in the field at any other location."

      The facility operates under a PDP-11/45, which is interfaced by the
      University to the PDP-10 and the ARPANET.

      Martin (Newell?) offered a seminar before spring 2025.

      > Attached hereto is a proposal written by Garland Stern and Lance
      > Williams to teach an animation seminar this spring.  In view of Steve's
      > departure and the completion of Martin's seminar, I offer to act as
      > faculty advisor to this project so that there can be an additional
      > course offering in computer graphics this spring. Garland and Lance are
      > both working on theses that involve computer animation, so I feel
      > comfortable that they could do an excellent job.  Moreover this activity
      > would be in line with their research interests.

      > The new graphics picture system, based on the PDP 11/45, will permit
      > films to be made with reduced load on the PDP 1 single-user.  Animation
      > files will be generated on the PDP 10 timesharing system and will be
      > read and prepared for the Watkin's hidden surface hardware by the
      > single-user.  The output, however, will be on magnetic tape, to be
      > transferred to and filmed on the PDP 11.  This will effect a substantial
      > savings in computer time on the single-user, which will no longer be
      > bound by the display time of the betascope/film chain.  Time on the
      > betascope will also be reduced due to the new configuration of the
      > display system.
      >
      > Necessary support for the seminar will thus include: 1) An account on
      > the time-sharing PDP-10, 2) limited use of the single-user PDP-1, and 3)
      > a budget to be used for film processing. For the latter,  a budget of
      > $200 proved adequate last year.

      A rendering system for many objects, running on TENEX. Describes its 26
      commands and has listings of example programs.

      Capitalization mine (originally all-caps):

      > INTRODUCTION
      >
      > DESIGN is a system which enables a user to assemble a collection of
      > objects and produce a picture with hidden surfaces removed.  Commands
      > are entered at a teletype console permitting continuous interaction with
      > the system.  Many hidden surface pictures can be computed in less than
      > 10 seconds of CPU time.  The scope of DESIGN is to allow a user to work
      > with a vast amount of objects.  A picture of a city with cubes
      > representing buildings or a picture of a frame structure of a building
      > can all be easily produced with DESIGN.  To adapt to a user's individual
      > needs, additional commands can be appended to the system with little
      > difficulty.  DESIGN is not an answer to the world's graphics problems,
      > but it can be adapted to many useful applications.

      Apparently operates on a PDP-10/50 running TENEX:
