   Position:                                    Computer Graphics Group Leader

   Responsibilities:                            Specification, development and
                                                maintenance of the graphics facilities
                                                at the Centre used by a wide range of
                                                industrial clients form all areas of
                                                engineering.

                                                This work involved developing software for
                                                a variety of computers including time
                                                sharing, stand alone, and combinations
                                                running concurrently.  The experience
                                                gained in working at all levels, from
