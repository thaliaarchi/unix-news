   Position:                                    Research Associate

   Responsibilities:                            Managing and extending the computer
                                                graphics facilities under contract with
                                                ARPA, and carrying out research in
                                                computer graphics in conjunction with
                                                the faculty and students.

                                                This work has involved a considerable

Current Activities and Interests________________________________

   In conjunction with my Ph.D. research I have been investigating the application
of procedural modeling techniques to the computer generation of continuous tone images
of three dimensional scenes.  These techniques have shown to permit the
processing of scenes of up to one hundred times the complexity previously practicable.
The application of these techniques to other areas related to computer aided design is
being investigated.

   Over the past two years I have been responsible for specifying and acquiring a new
facility specifically intended for further research into three dimensional modeling
techniques.  This facility, based on a PDP-11/45 computer, includes a dynamic line
drawing system and a solid state picture memory interfaced to a color TV monitor.
These devices, together with a variety of input devices, provide an advanced capability
for interaction with the modeling process.  The facility will be used for the
application of modeling techniques to selected areas of computer aided design and
image understanding research.
