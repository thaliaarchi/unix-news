  Early UNIX installations still running as of 1985:
  - Installed late 1972 or early 1973: Bell System 8th-Street site in LA
    (PDP-11/20? running Cosnix, a hacked derivative of V3)
  - After that: Bell Labs Whippany (PDP-11/45 #570 running Cosnix)
  - Columbia received Unix license number one
  - Late 1973: V4 licenses for University of Alberta (PDP-11/45 #315), Johns
    Hopkins University (PDP-11/45 #493, given to the Chemistry Department), and
    the Cooper Union (PDP-11/45, now running V6)
  - Late 1974: University of Toronto's original PDP-11/45
  - Late winter or spring 1975: University of Vermont, Vermont Lung Center
    (PDP-11/40 running an early V6)

  Out of curiosity, I'm interested in locating the oldest Unix machine
  that is still running Unix. U of T's original 11/45 is idle right now
  but will be running Unix again shortly; this sets a "latest bound" on
  the oldest machine, since our 45 appears to have been running Unix late
  in 1974. This was one of the first 20 or so licensed Unixes outside Bell.
  An older machine would have to be either inside Bell, or one of those
  early few.

  If the oldest machine turns out to be within Bell, I'm also interested
  in the oldest non-Bell Unix machine.

  Whatever machine is the oldest, it's not at the Murray Hill research
  lab. I've already asked Dennis about this; nothing in his vicinity
  is particularly old.

  Since PDP-7 Unix can safely be assumed to be dead, the oldest Unix
  machine will have to be an 11. Specifically, it will have to be a
  45, a 40, or just possibly a 20, since our 45 pre-dates the official
  announcement of the 70.

  Please reply to me by mail; I will post the results.

  Well, maybe not! DEC dragged a PDP-7 to its booth at UniForum in
  Dallas, and although they didn't get it running Unix for that
  show they were hot on the trail of a Unix tape for it. Maybe
  in Portland or Anaheim? (Are you interested in a machine that was
  running Unix in ancient times or an ancient machine running Unix?
  Clearly this is the latter.)

  There are indeed people within Dec who are making a serious effort to
  get Unix V1 running on a PDP-7. But my specific interest is in things
  that have been running Unix all along, not Unix newly brought up on a
  machine that happens to be an antique. (Anyone for a 7094 Unix port?)

  To give people a quick progress report on what I've found, the oldest
  Unix machine is unquestionably within Bell. There are still some old
  11s running derivatives of the assembler version of Unix, i.e. V3 or
  earlier. Obviously they are running canned applications, not serving
  as development environments. The oldest non-Bell Unix is less clear,
  and I'm still getting information on this. Our old 11/45 has quite
  definitely lost, by the way, since there were a handful of Unixes in
  the field rather earlier (probably before official licensing started,
  unless I've got the dates wrong).

  While I was in research at the University of Vermont, a group involved
  with the Vermont Lung Center program project grant bought an 11/40.
  After much frustration attempting to use RSX-11M Ver. 2.0 (for those
  who know, multi-user on "M" in those days was a dream), the person
  responsible for the system was convienced to try the "new" OS from
  Bell Labs. As I recall, this was around late winter or spring of 1975.
  The UN*X was version 6 (but real early). The system consisted of:

  PDP-11/40 CPU with EIA and FIS (useless for UN*X!!).
  32K core memory (DEC)
  16K core memory (Plessey)
  Dual RK03 2.4 meg. disk drives
  6 DL11-E single line interfaces
  Children's Museum's RK05 and DL11-E drivers

  That's right, a 48K machine. This machine ran like this until
  1979 when it was upgraded to an 11/45 (64K) + RK06's. I inherited
  the system in 1978 (and promptly worked an upgrade). The 11/45 ran
  until the project folded in 1984. Throughout the entire time, the
  original V6 code was used (no upgrade to V7 due to the applications).

  What I found impressive was the fact that not one line of kernel
  code was modified during that time (only I/O driver code, RK06s,
  tty driver, etc.). Most all of the system failures were due to
  power fails (V6 didn't cope with that condition well), or hardware
  problems. In fact, it was not uncommon towards the end for the 11/45
  system to run 3 or 4 months between reboots (and then only for PM).

  Well, the mail about still-operational ancient Unix machines has petered
  out, so here's the summary of results that I promised. For the purposes
  of terminology in this article, I will pretend that Bell-System divestiture
  didn't happen, since virtually all the events in question happened before
  the breakup.

  The oldest still-running Unix machine is unquestionably within the Bell
  System. The Murray Hill research lab long since put its old machines
  out to pasture, but there are some very old applications machines still
  operational.

  In particular, there are machines still running Cosnix, which was a hacked
  derivative of the assembly-language Unix (V3). Obviously these are not
  now used much as development machines, but as turnkey applications systems.
  Incidentally, some, possibly all, of the applications are written in the
  old "fc" semi-interpretive Fortran! 11/45 number 570 (numbers started at
  100, Research's 45 was 110) is still running Cosnix at Bell Labs Whippany.
  There is a still-older Cosnix machine in the Bell System 8th-Street site
  in LA; it was installed in late 72 or early 73. Considering the timing,
  this might be an 11/20 rather than a 45. This would appear to be the
  Grand Prize winner for oldest Unix still operating.

  Outside the Bell System, the picture is less clear. Unix license number
  one went to Columbia, but this may not be too significant; I don't have
  dates for the licenses, and in any case license dates don't necessarily
  correlate with operational dates. Of the people I actually got responses
  from, it would appear to be a three-way tie, all for V4 in late 1973,
  between U of Alberta (11/45 #315, still running), Johns Hopkins U (11/45
  #493, given to Chemistry Dept. but believed still running), and the Cooper
  Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (a small NYC engineering
  school) (11/45, #???, still running, possibly still V4!).

  Corrections and addenda would be appreciated.

  Thanks to all the people who replied with information, notably Dennis
  Ritchie and John Mashey for the info on the Cosnix systems.

  Yes, Cooper still has their '45 going strong, but with V6. I
  learned on that machine during my undergrad years there (1977-81). They
  added a 160 Mb fuji since I left, but still boot off the 2 RK-05's they had
  when I got there (yup, 5 Mb total disk space).

  Isn't it amazing how 32 people can do real work on a machine with
  256K of core (I think they finally upgraded to MOS ram) and a kernal that
  only takes up about 20K?
