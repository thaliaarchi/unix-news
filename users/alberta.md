  UNIX V4 was shipped to the University in October 1973. Although they had a
  PDP-9, it apparently never ran UNIX-7.

  > Now let us consider some of the most important computers acquired by the
  > Department during the 1970s. The first computer was a used Digital Equipment
  > Corporation PDP-9 which was purchased from American Used Computer in 1970
  > for 19 700 dollars. This system had 8K of 18-bit memory, an Extended
  > Arithmetic Element to speed up multiplication, division and shifting, a
  > teleletype console and oscilloscope display, a paper tape reader and punch,
  > and a card reader. The cycle time was one microsecond; addition required two
  > cycles. Two 256K fixed-head disks having an average access time of seventeen
  > milliseconds were added shortly, and a Sykes Compucorder 100 cassette tape
  > drive was added in 1972. The software include the DOS-9 operating system,
  > FORTRAN IV, FOCAL which was an interpreter similar to BASIC, an assembler
  > and an editor. The PDP-9 was used for a large number of small projects as
  > well as for Wayne Davis's research in image processing. This research was
  > moved to the PDP-11/60 in 1977. When the PDP-9 was purchased the Hour Meter
  > registered 6 634 hours. When it was sold as surplus in 1980 the Hour Meter
  > was at 15 993 hours.
  >
  > In the budget for 1971/72 John Hauer, Barry Mailloux and Tony Marsland
  > proposed that the Department purchase immediately a PDP-11/20 system at a
  > cost of between 45 000 and 70 000 dollars. Another machine was to be
  > purchased the following year. Experience in teaching and research with this
  > equipment together with the PDP-9 would be invaluable in determining the
  > requirements for a larger machine. However, only 20 000 dollars was made
  > available as a result of this request, and this money was used to purchase
  > the disks for the PDP-9. The following year a proposal was submitted for the
  > newly announced PDP-11/45. This proposal was accepted, and in June 1972 an
  > order for the 11/45 at a cost of 45 000 dollars was placed. The system,
  > which arrived the following January, had a 16K core memory, a removable disk
  > of 1.2M words, card reader, and a Centronics dot matrix printer. The
  > operating system was DOS-11 which, unfortunately, did not use many of the
  > features of the PDP-11 including the Memory Management Unit. Therefore, Tony
  > Marsland proposed that the Department obtain a copy of the UNIX operating
  > system from the Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey where he had
  > worked before coming to the University of Alberta. One reason for obtaining
  > UNIX was that it would enable him to match the Belle chess program developed
  > at the Bell Laboratories on the PDP-11/45 with his own program, Wita, which
  > ran under MTS on the IBM 360/67. The fourth edition of UNIX was shipped to
  > the University in October 1973; it is believed to be the first version of
  > UNIX used outside of AT&T. The PDP-11/45 was for some persons the most
  > significant of the Department's computers, and was used in numerous research
  > projects. It was called "Chatty Cathy” because of the work of Dan Salomon
  > who used it for a project on voice synthesis. On January 14, 1986 at 2:53
  > p.m. it registered one hundred thousand hours of use, an event which was
  > marked by an appropriate celebration, after which it was formally retired.
  > The PDP-11/45 was kept in the Department in recognition of its important
  > role in teaching and research.

  This claims that this is "believed to be the first use of UNIX outside of
  AT&T", but Ken lists Columbia before Alberta. This appears to be rephrased
  from "The fourth edition of UNIX was shipped to the University in October
  1973; it is believed to be the first version of UNIX used outside of AT&T"
  [Smillie 1991], which refers to V4 not to Alberta, so this may be
  unintentional.

  The partial chronology duplicates the chronology of [Smillie 1991] through
  1989 with only minor edits and extends it to 2013. "UNIX installed" is added
  to the 1973 entry:
