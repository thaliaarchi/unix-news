     Well here it is !!!!

     WHAT ?????

     At the last User Group Meeting in August it was decided that a newsletter should be
produced to be distributed among Unix users in Australia so here it is the inaugural Australian
UNIX User's Group Newsletter (AUUGN for short - nothing phallic intended). This Newsletter will
attempt to promote better communication twixt the growing number of UNIX users in Australia, BUT
a Newsletter is only as good as those who contribute SO if at any time information that may be
of use or interest to other UNIX users comes your way please forward it for inclusion in the
next issue.

     It is my intention to produce six Newsletters a year. If you do not wish to receive the
Newsletter just let me know, On the other hand if you do wish to receive it and are not on the
attached list please mail your address.

This newsletter early in its life was very good value, in the last year it has been very patchy
which I suspect resulted from the vast number of people wanting it. Now that a fee is involved
I beleive that it should be worth receiving. If you wish to subscribe then forward a cheque
(payable to 'The Rockerfeller University') to:
