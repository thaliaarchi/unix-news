                               THIRD SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION

     The Third Software Distribution is now being prepared  for  release.   We  expect  to
start  mailing  it out in late July.  The Software Distribution Center has been moved from
Chicago Circle to the City University of New York.  We all owe Mike O'Brien a debt of gra-
titude  for the work he has done in setting up the software distribution service.  Mike is
leaving Chicago for the West Coast soon.   He prepared  the  Third  Distribution  and  has
passed  on  to  me  (Mel  Ferentz)  all of the tapes people sent him as well as the entire
correspondence file.

     The distributions will be prepared on the City University's 360/168, which we view as
a  suitable back-end for a UNIX system.  Complete details on the distribution will be con-
tained in the next Unix News.  Those of you who have already sent tapes  to  Chicago  will
receive  your  tapes  mailed from New York.  No further tapes should be mailed to Chicago.
The CUNY Computer Center sells tapes over-the-counter and while we will continue to  write
onto  your tape if you send one, the preferred medium for us is to write your distribution
on a virgin 2400 foot tape.  An order form will be included with the next newsletter.


                                      URBANA MEETING

     The Urbana Meeting was attended by over 150 people and was a great success.  The  at-
tendance  list  will  be published as soon as we get a tape from Steve Holmgren to replace
the one he sent us that was folded and spindled by our favorite postal service.

     We have been promised minutes of the meeting which will also appear as  soon  as  re-
ceived.


                           CHILDREN'S MUSEUM INFORMATION SYSTEM

     The Children's Museum has announced the availability of  its  "Information  System  -
Version 3".  A four page product description was distributed at the Urbana Meeting.  For a
copy of the description, more details, or licensing information contact Bill  Mayhew,  The
Children's Museum, Jamaicaway, Boston, MA 02130.


                                 FUTURE SOFTWARE RELEASES

     At the Urbana Meeting it was said (announced is too  strong  a  verb)  that  Bell  is
preparing  Programmer's  Work  Bench  for  release this summer with Version 7 of Unix soon
thereafter.  Mini-Unix has been released and LSI-Unix and Mert will probably follow  along
at some later date.
