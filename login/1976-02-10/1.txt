                                   DISCLOSURE

     Our correspondence  with  Western  Electric  vis-a-vis  the  non-disclosure
agreement  is  reproduced  in this issue.  It is agreed that as long as a notice
similar to the one printed above appears, we may disclose  to  each  other.   In
machine readable form, share modifications to the licensed software  by  sending
the modified text.


                                    HOTLINE

     The Unix Hotline telephone  number  is  212-489-0337.   It  is  a  300-baud
DL11-E.  The login name "unixnews" has no password and connects to a shell which
is a stripped down version of "ed".  We hope its use  is  self  explanatory  and
your comments and improvements are solicited.


                                    MEETINGS

     Notices of the next meetings on East and West Coasts  are  included  below.
Since  the  notice was printed, Mike Stonebraker of Berkeley has agreed to speak
at the West Coast Meeting on INGRESS, his relational data base system.

     The East Coast meeting will concentrate on  graphics  on  Thursday  and  on
everything else on Friday.  Details will appear in the next Unix News and on the
Hotline.


                               SOFTWARE EXCHANGE

     Arrangements have been made to establish a central  facility  for  the  ex-
change  of  machine  readable  materials.  The University of Illinois at Chicago
Circle has offered its facilities.  Magnetic tapes, Dectapes, or rk-disks should
be sent to:

                    Michael T. O'Brien
                    Dept of Information Engineering
                    University of Illinois at Chicago Circle
                    Box 4348
                    Chicago, Illinois 60630

     At least initially, the plan is to collect everything sent in and  to  send
everything  to  each  installation on request.  Special arrangements can be made
with Mike for materials covered by licenses.  Rather than tying the distribution
to  particular dates, Mike will ship what he has when he receives your tape.  He
does ask that installations request distributions no more frequently than  every
three months.
