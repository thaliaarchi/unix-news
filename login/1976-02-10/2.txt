     The preferred medium is 800-bpi magtape, with dectape as second choice.  If
you only have 1600-bpi, mail your tape to:

                    Melvin Ferentz
                    Physics Dept.
                    Brooklyn College of CUNY
                    Brooklyn, N. Y.  11210

     Mike will be sending 800-bpi tapes regularly to Brooklyn  where  there  are
dual-density drives.

     No, it wasn't the mails, it was us.  There was no November 1975 issue.  Our
mailing  list was messed up and we didn't get a new list of licensees until mid-
January.  We promise to try to do better this year.

     This issue was prepared in mid-February.  We expect the next  issue  to  go
out in mid-March.  Mailings, no matter how thin will be monthly.

     Several installations have commented on their difficulties  in  reproducing
from  our  hectographed newsletter.  Starting with this issue we will use photo-
copier and/or offset.  To reduce bulk, we will, whenever practical,  reduce  two
pages  to  one.   Also starting with this issue, we will copy, without modifica-
tion, all correspondence that we feel is of general interest.


                                     MONEY

     To support mailing and reproduction costs at Brooklyn and at  Chicago  Cir-
cle,  we  are  asking  for $10.00 from each installation.  This should cover ex-
penses for the year.  We can send an "invoice" if your purchasing procedures re-
quire it.  Checks should be sent to Mel Ferentz and be made payable to "Brooklyn
College Association" which has agreed to act as fiscal agent.
