Dear Dr. Ferentz:


Enclosed are copies of our documentation and source code for  the
new RK driver and for the CR and DK11-E drivers.

As you will note, the RK driver and its documentation are  rather
lengthy.  It may well be unreasonable for them to appear directly
in the Unix News. One solution, therefore,  would  simply  be  to
inform  other users of its existence and have them write directly
to me for copies. On the other hand, I can supply spirit duplica-
tor masters of them if you like from our Qume printer.

You can publish any section of this stuff  that  seems  relevant.
The  rest  may be kept for your own use or garbaged, as appropri-
ate.

In  any event, I would appreciate your publication of the follow-
ing notice in the News:

"Software  now  available for free distribution to UNIX licensees
from the Children's Museum includes:

1.  A  new,  highly-optimized  driver for the RK11/RO03/RK05 disk
cartridge system;
2. A version of FOCAL, implemented in C;
3. A driver for the CR11 card reader;
4. A driver for the DL11-E modem control typewriter interface.
