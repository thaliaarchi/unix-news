     UNIX at the Children's Museum has  been  fully  operational  since  August,
1974.  Development  work  jointly  with  Harvard  University  began the previous
winter, making us one of the first non-Bell users.

Our hardware configuration includes :

     *PDP11/40 processor with EIS
     *48K core memory (MM/MF11-L)
     *KW11L line clock
     *2 RK03 (a.k.a. Diablo) disk drives on RK11-c controller
     *6 VT05 terminals operating at 600 and 2400 baud on DL11-E controllers
     *1 LA30 DECwriter at 300 baud on DL11-A
     *1 ASR33 teletype on DL11-A
     *1 ComData modem on dialup line, 110 baud on DL11-E
     *1 LP11-HA upper/lower case 80-column line printer
     *1 VOTRAX VS-5 voice synthesizer on DK11-E
     *1 QUME Q30 high-quality 30-cps printer
        (a.k.a. Diablo HyType, or the guts of the QSI etc. terminal) on DR11-C

Further, we are designing and  will  begin  construction  soon  on  several  new
hardware  devices  and interfaces, including a dirt-cheap DR11-C equivalent that
is capable of driving our scaled-down elcheapo versions of things like the  LOGO
project's "turtle".

Our hardware and software is extensively kidproofed, and modifications have been
made to the UNIX terminal driver to include modes whereby newline characters are
ignored on "empty" or "null" lines, and whereby all characters typed by the user
are thrown away if the system si in the midst of typing on the terminal. Attrac-
tive rubout handling (backspace-erase line) has also been added for VT05  termi-
nals.

Software that we have developed that may be of interest to other users includes:

*FOCAL, written in C and modeled after PDP-8 FOCAL by a high-school student
*a PDP-8 simulator (simple memory-and-a-single-terminal machines only at this
  time), also in C, by the same student (interrupts are not currently being
  supported but are being worked on)
*a rewritten standard UNIX shell (pipelines not yet implemented)
  with user-settable prompts, a "change to default directory" command,
  standard accounting options, a monitor option that copies all typein to a
  hidden file (for keeping tabs on potentially malicious users), and others
*a new more-conversational PS command that displays critical process data
  in English (SWAPPED/IN CORE, SLEEP/WAIT/RUN, etc.)
*an RK disk driver that optimizes seeking through queue-diddling.

Under development and scheduled for imminent completion is a general-purpose in-
formation  storage and retrieval system. A license fee will probably be made for
nonprofits  on  request.  Please  contact me to discuss media conversion; we can
supply RK disk, DECtape, or paper (gak) tape.
