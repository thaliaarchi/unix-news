                                        UNIX NEWS

     Due to the closing of facilities of the City University of New York  at  the  end  of
May, there was no May issue of Unix News.  The University is back in business and we would
hope there will be no further closings.  Our fiscal year and our current Board of Trustees
both expire at the end of June.

     The suggestion from Australia that the hotline information be captured is well taken.
We  will,  in  the  future, reproduce all hotline information which is worthy of permanent
recording in Unix News and remove it from the hotline file.  The hotline will then contain
only messages less than two months old.

     The response to the survey questionaire has been approximately 30% to date.  It  will
be compiled and made available.  If we can arrange for the keyboarding, it will be machine
readable and available from the Chicago Circle Software Exchange as well as  on  line.   A
concise form of the "haves" and "wants" will be published here.


                                    SOFTWARE EXCHANGE

     Notice is reproduced below of the first mailing from the Software Exchange.   If  you
are on the reproduced list you will receive a tape.  If you are not and want a copy send a
magnetic tape or 5 Dectapes.

     The Harvard software, with the exception of Basic is now at Chicago Circle.   If  you
wish  the Harvard software, sign the license agreement and mail it together with a tape to
Chicago.  If you are not an academic institution, or if you want Basic, get in touch  with
Lew Law at Harvard.  Ignore the part of the notice that asks for money if you are ordering
from Chicago.

     If you attempt to use the new archiver, you will need the program below:



                               mktemp(name)
                               char *name;
                               {       register char *ptr;
                                       register r;

                                       ptr = name;
                                       while (*ptr++);
                                       --ptr;
                                       r = getpid();
                                       do  *--ptr = '0' + (r%10);
                                               while (r = r/10);
                                       while    (stat(name) >= 0)
                                               *--ptr = 'a';
                                       return(name);
                               }
