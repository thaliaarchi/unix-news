                                         MEETINGS

     Notice is given in the letter from the University of New South  Wales  of  the  first
Eastern Hemisphere "East Coast Meeting".

     Our Correspondent's notes have been misplaced and the report on the  Harvard  meeting
will appear in a future issue.


                                         MANUALS

     The response to Harvard's offer to print the manuals was much greater  than  expected
and  the  offer is repeated.  The original notice, with a new closing date, follows:

     The Science Center at Harvard is willing to undertake the  task  of  reproducing  and
distributing  the manuals for UNIX.  The enclosed order form may be returned no later than
August 2, 1976.  All orders received by that date will be part  of  the  second  printing.
Closing dates for subsequent printings, if any, will be announced.

     For logistical reasons, each of the manuals  will  be  available  only  as  indicated
below,  with  3 hole punching and no binding.  Orders should be batched, one order per in-
stallation and will be mailed to a single address which must be at the users' group's  ad-
dress of record for the installation.

     The "UNIX PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL" Sixth Edition dated May 1975 will be reproduced in its
entirety.   Most installations will want to remove several pages which most users need not
worry about.

     "DOCUMENTS FOR USE WITH THE UNIX TIME-SHARING SYSTEM" Sixth Edition  will  be  repro-
duced omitting sections 1 (Setting Up UNIX) and 13 (On the Security of Unix).

     The price of each manual will be dependent upon the total number of orders  for  that
manual  and  will range between $8.00, if 100 copies are printed, and $12.00, if as few as
10 copies are printed.  The order form may be sent in advance of, or with purchase  orders
or checks.  Assume the $12.00 figure.  Correct invoices and refunds will be sent.


                                     SEVENTH EDITION?

     Conversations with Dick Shahpazian  and  Dennis  Ritchie  indicate  some  ambivalence
within  Bell-Western with respect to a new edition of UNIX.  There are a number of changes
that exist at Murray Hill and Ken Thompson is bringing many more back  from  his  year  at
Berkeley.   It  seems  clear that there will eventually be a new edition incorporating the
non-incremental changes.  The question that is still unresolved is whether a "totally  de-
bugged"  edition  six  will  be  formally, or informally, released to the users before the
quantum jump to edition seven.

     Mike O'Brien and I have expressed the desire that such a  release  be   made  to  the
software  exchange,  if  only  for archival purposes.  The argument against, of course, is
that time taken by Ritchie and Thompson to produce such a version is time taken away  from
new  goodies  and the preparation of the next version for distribution.  We don't know how
influential they will be, but your comments are welcome and if sent to Unix News  will  be
read by the powers that be at the vendor.
