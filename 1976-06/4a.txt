     new C compiler which we can't distribute yet.  Therefore, executable
     modules are included.  Instructions included.

10)  Modified "ac.c" - takes "-t" flag to do accounting over ports as well as
     people.  Useful for finding out which terminals or lines are used most
     often.

11)  Modified "kl.c" which handles DL-11E dialup lines.  Expects hardware to
     handle second-party and long-space disconnects, but is smaller than #5.

     The modified versions of C, nroff, and UNIX cannot be distributed until

Bell Laboratories has released them.  If Bell decides that they have been

"substantially changed", any or all of them may require a separate license

from Western Electric.

     The Harvard HRSTSS software is separately handled.  This edition of the

newsletter should include an order form for the software.  The manuals must

still be purchased from Harvard.

     The following should be a complete list of those slated to receive a tape.

If you want your name added to the list, send a magtape or several DECtapes to:
