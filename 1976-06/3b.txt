CONTENTS OF FIRST MAILING
UNIX SDC

1)  Motorola M6800 assembler  (C)

2)  "em" (ed for mortals) - for faster terminals.  A superset of ed.  (C)

3)  "setup" - general management package for downline loading of satellites  (C)

Above from Jon Rowson, Queen Mary College, University of London.

4)  Ken Knowlton's EXPLOR and MINI-EXPLOR in FORTRAN, plus MINI-EXPLOR in C -
    for easy, fancy line-printer graphics.  With examples.

5)  DL-11E driver  which handles dialups.  Good for CENTREX phone systems which
    do not have long-space disconnect or second-party disconnect in the
    hardware.  (C)

Above from Lou Katz, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.


6)  "rtpip" - file-handling package which can transfer DECtape and RK05 files
    between UNIX and RT-11 formats.  Well commented and documented.

Above from Computer Science Group, Katholieke Universiteit, Netherlands.


7)  PDP 11/40 UNIX FORTRAN - completely rewritten runtime system, uses 11/40
    FIS and runs on no other kind of machine (except Cal Data's with FIS, of
    course).  Runs fast, but supports single precision only.

8)  "convert", and attempt at a program to convert 11/45 Floating Point assembly
    language to 11/40's by inserting a "jsr" to a special entry in "fptrap".
    Each floating instruction thereby grows by two words, but no signalling
    takes place.  System overhead is greatly lowered.  May fail if assembly
    source is in very weird format.

9)  New archiver - includes "ar.c", new "ld.c" which reads the new style, and
    "arcv.c" which converts from old to new formats.  The stinker is that
    "ar.c" uses long (double-word) integers, which can only be compiled by the
